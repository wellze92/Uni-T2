what bloody man is that he can report as seemeth by his plight of the revolt the newest state 

this is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought gainst my captivity hail brave friend say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it 

sergeant

doubtful it stood as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art the merciless macdonwald worthy to be a rebel for to that the multiplying villanies of nature do swarm upon him from the western isles of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling show'd like a rebel's whore but all's too weak for brave macbeth well he deserves that name disdaining fortune with his brandish'd steel which smoked with bloody execution like valour's minion carved out his passage till he faced the slave which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps and fix'd his head upon our battlements 

o valiant cousin worthy gentleman 

sergeant

as whence the sun gins his reflection shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break so from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come discomfort swells mark king of scotland mark no sooner justice had with valour arm'd compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels but the norweyan lord surveying vantage with furbish'd arms and new supplies of men began a fresh assault 

dismay'd not this our captains macbeth and banquo 

sergeant

yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion if i say sooth i must report they were as cannons overcharged with double cracks so they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds or memorise another golgotha i cannot tell but i am faint my gashes cry for help 

so well thy words become thee as thy wounds they smack of honour both go get him surgeons exit sergeant attended who comes here enter ross

the worthy thane of ross 

what a haste looks through his eyes so should he look that seems to speak things strange 

god save the king 

whence camest thou worthy thane 

from fife great king where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold norway himself with terrible numbers assisted by that most disloyal traitor the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict till that bellona's bridegroom lapp'd in proof confronted him with self comparisons point against point rebellious arm gainst arm curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude the victory fell on us 

great happiness 

that now sweno the norways king craves composition nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed at saint colme's inch ten thousand dollars to our general use 

no more that thane of cawdor shall deceive our bosom interest go pronounce his present death and with his former title greet macbeth 

i'll see it done

so foul and fair a day i have not seen 

how far is't call'd to forres what are these so wither'd and so wild in their attire that look not like the inhabitants o the earth and yet are on't live you or are you aught that man may question you seem to understand me by each at once her chappy finger laying upon her skinny lips you should be women and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so 

speak if you can what are you 

first witch

all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of glamis 

second witch

all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor 

third witch

all hail macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter 

good sir why do you start and seem to fear things that do sound so fair i the name of truth are ye fantastical or that indeed which outwardly ye show my noble partner you greet with present grace and great prediction of noble having and of royal hope that he seems rapt withal to me you speak not if you can look into the seeds of time and say which grain will grow and which will not speak then to me who neither beg nor fear your favours nor your hate 

first witch

hail 

second witch

hail 

third witch

first witch

lesser than macbeth and greater 

second witch

not so happy yet much happier 

third witch

thou shalt get kings though thou be none so all hail macbeth and banquo 

first witch

banquo and macbeth all hail 

stay you imperfect speakers tell me more by sinel's death i know i am thane of glamis but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives a prosperous gentleman and to be king stands not within the prospect of belief no more than to be cawdor say from whence you owe this strange intelligence or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you witches vanish

the earth hath bubbles as the water has and these are of them whither are they vanish'd 

into the air and what seem'd corporal melted as breath into the wind would they had stay'd 

were such things here as we do speak about or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner 

your children shall be kings 

you shall be king 

and thane of cawdor too went it not so 

to the selfsame tune and words who's here enter ross and angus

the king hath happily received macbeth the news of thy success and when he reads thy personal venture in the rebels fight his wonders and his praises do contend which should be thine or his silenced with that in viewing o'er the rest o the selfsame day he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks nothing afeard of what thyself didst make strange images of death as thick as hail came post with post and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdom's great defence and pour'd them down before him 

we are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks only to herald thee into his sight not pay thee 

and for an earnest of a greater honour he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor in which addition hail most worthy thane for it is thine 

what can the devil speak true 

the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me in borrow'd robes 

who was the thane lives yet but under heavy judgment bears that life which he deserves to lose whether he was combined with those of norway or did line the rebel with hidden help and vantage or that with both he labour'd in his country's wreck i know not but treasons capital confess'd and proved have overthrown him 

 aside glamis and thane of cawdor the greatest is behind to ross and angus thanks for your pains to banquo do you not hope your children shall be kings when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me promised no less to them 

that trusted home might yet enkindle you unto the crown besides the thane of cawdor but tis strange and oftentimes to win us to our harm the instruments of darkness tell us truths win us with honest trifles to betray's in deepest consequence cousins a word i pray you 

 aside two truths are told as happy prologues to the swelling act of the imperial theme i thank you gentlemen aside cannot be ill cannot be good if ill why hath it given me earnest of success commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor if good why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs against the use of nature present fears are less than horrible imaginings my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical shakes so my single state of man that function is smother'd in surmise and nothing is but what is not 

look how our partner's rapt 

 aside if chance will have me king why chance may crown me without my stir 

new horrors come upon him like our strange garments cleave not to their mould but with the aid of use 

 aside come what come may time and the hour runs through the roughest day 

worthy macbeth we stay upon your leisure 

give me your favour my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains are register'd where every day i turn the leaf to read them let us toward the king think upon what hath chanced and at more time the interim having weigh'd it let us speak our free hearts each to other 

very gladly 

till then enough come friends 

scene iv forres the palace 

flourish enter duncan malcolm donalbain lennox and attendants

is execution done on cawdor are not those in commission yet return'd 

my liege they are not yet come back but i have spoke with one that saw him die who did report that very frankly he confess'd his treasons implored your highness pardon and set forth a deep repentance nothing in his life became him like the leaving it he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as twere a careless trifle 

there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face he was a gentleman on whom i built an absolute trust enter macbeth banquo ross and angus o worthiest cousin the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me thou art so far before that swiftest wing of recompense is slow to overtake thee would thou hadst less deserved that the proportion both of thanks and payment might have been mine only i have left to say more is thy due than more than all can pay 

the service and the loyalty i owe in doing it pays itself your highness part is to receive our duties and our duties are to your throne and state children and servants which do but what they should by doing every thing safe toward your love and honour 

welcome hither i have begun to plant thee and will labour to make thee full of growing noble banquo that hast no less deserved nor must be known no less to have done so let me enfold thee and hold thee to my heart 

there if i grow the harvest is your own 

my plenteous joys wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow sons kinsmen thanes and you whose places are the nearest know we will establish our estate upon our eldest malcolm whom we name hereafter the prince of cumberland which honour must not unaccompanied invest him only but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine on all deservers from hence to inverness and bind us further to you 

the rest is labour which is not used for you i'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach so humbly take my leave 

my worthy cawdor 

 aside the prince of cumberland that is a step on which i must fall down or else o'erleap for in my way it lies stars hide your fires let not light see my black and deep desires the eye wink at the hand yet let that be which the eye fears when it is done to see 

true worthy banquo he is full so valiant and in his commendations i am fed it is a banquet to me let's after him whose care is gone before to bid us welcome it is a peerless kinsman flourish exeunt

this castle hath a pleasant seat the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses 

this guest of summer the temple haunting martlet does approve by his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath smells wooingly here no jutty frieze buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle where they most breed and haunt i have observed the air is delicate enter lady macbeth

all our service in every point twice done and then done double were poor and single business to contend against those honours deep and broad wherewith your majesty loads our house for those of old and the late dignities heap'd up to them we rest your hermits 

where's the thane of cawdor we coursed him at the heels and had a purpose to be his purveyor but he rides well and his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him to his home before us fair and noble hostess we are your guest to night 

your servants ever have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt to make their audit at your highness pleasure still to return your own

hautboys and torches enter a sewer and divers servants with dishes and service and pass over the stage then enter macbeth

if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly if the assassination could trammel up the consequence and catch with his surcease success that but this blow might be the be all and the end all here but here upon this bank and shoal of time we'ld jump the life to come but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague the inventor this even handed justice commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice to our own lips he's here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself besides this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpet tongued against the deep damnation of his taking off and pity like a naked new born babe striding the blast or heaven's cherubim horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air shall blow the horrid deed in every eye that tears shall drown the wind i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other enter lady macbeth how now what news 

he has almost supp'd why have you left the chamber 

hath he ask'd for me 

know you not he has 

we will proceed no further in this business he hath honour'd me of late and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss not cast aside so soon 

was the hope drunk wherein you dress'd yourself hath it slept since and wakes it now to look so green and pale at what it did so freely from this time such i account thy love art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valour as thou art in desire wouldst thou have that which thou esteem'st the ornament of life and live a coward in thine own esteem letting i dare not wait upon i would like the poor cat i the adage 

prithee peace i dare do all that may become a man who dares do more is none 

what beast was't then that made you break this enterprise to me when you durst do it then you were a man and to be more than what you were you would be so much more the man nor time nor place did then adhere and yet you would make both they have made themselves and that their fitness now does unmake you i have given suck and know how tender tis to love the babe that milks me i would while it was smiling in my face have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums and dash'd the brains out had i so sworn as you have done to this 

if we should fail 

we fail but screw your courage to the sticking place and we'll not fail when duncan is asleep whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey soundly invite him his two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince that memory the warder of the brain shall be a fume and the receipt of reason a limbeck only when in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death what cannot you and i perform upon the unguarded duncan what not put upon his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt of our great quell 

bring forth men children only for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males will it not be received when we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers that they have done't 

who dares receive it other as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar upon his death

being unprepared our will became the servant to defect which else should free have wrought 

all's well i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters to you they have show'd some truth 

i think not of them yet when we can entreat an hour to serve we would spend it in some words upon that business if you would grant the time 

at your kind'st leisure 

if you shall cleave to my consent when tis it shall make honour for you 

so i lose none in seeking to augment it but still keep my bosom franchised and allegiance clear i shall be counsell'd

that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold what hath quench'd them hath given me fire hark peace it was the owl that shriek'd the fatal bellman which gives the stern'st good night he is about it the doors are open and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores i have drugg'd their possets that death and nature do contend about them whether they live or die 

 within who's there what ho 

alack i am afraid they have awaked and tis not done the attempt and not the deed confounds us hark i laid their daggers ready he could not miss em had he not resembled my father as he slept i had done't enter macbeth my husband

as i descended

hark who lies i the second chamber 

donalbain 

this is a sorry sight looking on his hands

a foolish thought to say a sorry sight 

there's one did laugh in's sleep and one cried murder that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers and address'd them again to sleep 

there are two lodged together 

one cried god bless us and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangman's hands listening their fear i could not say amen when they did say god bless us 

consider it not so deeply 

but wherefore could not i pronounce amen i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat 

these deeds must not be thought after these ways so it will make us mad 

methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care the death of each day's life sore labour's bath balm of hurt minds great nature's second course chief nourisher in life's feast 

what do you mean 

still it cried sleep no more to all the house glamis hath murder'd sleep and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more macbeth shall sleep no more 

who was it that thus cried why worthy thane you do unbend your noble strength to think so brainsickly of things go get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand why did you bring these daggers from the place they must lie there go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood 

i'll go no more i am afraid to think what i have done look on't again i dare not 

infirm of purpose give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil if he do bleed i'll gild the faces of the grooms withal for it must seem their guilt exit knocking within

porter

'faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and drink sir is a great provoker of three things 

what three things does drink especially provoke 

porter

marry sir nose painting sleep and urine lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it takes away the performance therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him 

i believe drink gave thee the lie last night 

porter

that it did sir i the very throat on me but i requited him for his lie and i think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet i made a shift to cast him

wherefore did you so

and duncan's horses a thing most strange and certain beauteous and swift the minions of their race turn'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out contending gainst obedience as they would make war with mankind 

old man

'tis said they eat each other 

they did so to the amazement of mine eyes that look'd upon't here comes the good macduff enter macduff how goes the world sir now 

why see you not 

is't known who did this more than bloody deed 

those that macbeth hath slain 

alas the day what good could they pretend 

they were suborn'd malcolm and donalbain the king's two sons are stol'n away and fled which puts upon them suspicion of the deed 

'gainst nature still thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up thine own life's means then tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth 

he is already named and gone to scone to be invested 

where is duncan's body 

carried to colmekill the sacred storehouse of his predecessors and guardian of their bones

they are my lord without the palace gate 

bring them before us exit attendant to be thus is nothing but to be safely thus our fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear'd tis much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked as it is said mark antony's was by caesar he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophet like they hail'd him father to a line of kings upon my head they placed a fruitless crown and put a barren sceptre in my gripe thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding if t be so for banquo's issue have i filed my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murder'd put rancours in the vessel of my peace only for them and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seed of banquo kings rather than so come fate into the list and champion me to the utterance who's there re enter attendant with two murderers now go to the door and stay there till we call exit attendant was it not yesterday we spoke together 

first murderer

it was so please your highness 

well then now have you consider'd of my speeches know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune which you thought had been our innocent self this i made good to you in our last conference pass'd in probation with you how you were borne in hand how cross'd the instruments who wrought with them and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say thus did banquo 

first murderer

you made it known to us 

i did so and went further which is now our point of second meeting do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go are you so gospell'd to pray for this good man and for his issue whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave and beggar'd yours for ever 

first murderer

we are men my liege 

ay in the catalogue ye go for men as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are clept all by the name of dogs the valued file distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle the housekeeper the hunter every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed whereby he does receive particular addition from the bill that writes them all alike and so of men now if you have a station in the file not i the worst rank of manhood say t and i will put that business in your bosoms whose execution takes your enemy off grapples you to the heart and love of us who wear our health but sickly in his life which in his death were perfect 

second murderer

i am one my liege whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that i am reckless what i do to spite the world 

first murderer

and i another so weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune that i would set my lie on any chance to mend it or be rid on't 

both of you know banquo was your enemy 

both murderers

true my lord 

so is he mine and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons 

second murderer

we shall my lord perform what you command us 

first murderer

though our lives 

your spirits shine through you within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time the moment on't for't must be done to night and something from the palace always thought that i require a clearness and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work fleance his son that keeps him company whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's must embrace the fate of that dark hour resolve yourselves apart i'll come to you anon 

both murderers

we are resolved my lord 

i'll call upon you straight abide within exeunt murderers it is concluded banquo thy soul's flight if it find heaven must find it out to night 

scene ii the palace 

enter lady macbeth and a servant

is banquo gone from court 

servant

ay madam but returns again to night 

say to the king i would attend his leisure for a few words 

servant

madam i will 

nought's had all's spent where our desire is got without content tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy enter macbeth how now my lord why do you keep alone of sorriest fancies your companions making using those thoughts which should indeed have died with them they think on things without all remedy should be without regard what's done is done 

we have scotch'd the snake not kill'd it she'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave after life's fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further 

come on gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks be bright and jovial among your guests to night 

so shall i love and so i pray be you let your remembrance apply to banquo present him eminence both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we must lave our honours in these flattering streams and make our faces vizards to our hearts disguising what they are 

you must leave this 

o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives 

but in them nature's copy's not eterne 

there's comfort yet they are assailable then be thou jocund ere the bat hath flown his cloister'd flight ere to black hecate's summons the shard borne beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done a deed of dreadful note 

what's to be done 

be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck till thou applaud the deed come seeling night scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood good things of day begin to droop and drowse while night's black agents to their preys do rouse thou marvell'st at my words but hold thee still things bad begun make strong themselves by ill so prithee go with me

first murderer

first murderer

ay and a bold one that dare look on that which might appal the devil 

o proper stuff this is the very painting of your fear this is the air drawn dagger which you said led you to duncan o these flaws and starts impostors to true fear would well become a woman's story at a winter's fire authorized by her grandam shame itself why do you make such faces when all's done you look but on a stool 

prithee see there behold look lo how say you why what care i if thou canst nod speak too if charnel houses and our graves must send those that we bury back our monuments shall be the maws of kites ghost of banquo vanishes

if i stand here i saw him 

fie for shame 

blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time ere human statute purged the gentle weal ay and since too murders have been perform'd too terrible for the ear the times have been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools this is more strange than such a murder is 

my worthy lord your noble friends do lack you 

i do forget do not muse at me my most worthy friends i have a strange infirmity which is nothing to those that know me come love and health to all then i'll sit down give me some wine fill full i drink to the general joy o the whole table and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss would he were here to all and him we thirst and all to all 

lords

our duties and the pledge re enter ghost of banquo

avaunt and quit my sight let the earth hide thee thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with 

think of this good peers but as a thing of custom tis no other only it spoils the pleasure of the time 

what man dare i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear the arm'd rhinoceros or the hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert with thy sword if trembling i inhabit then protest me the baby of a girl hence horrible shadow unreal mockery hence ghost of banquo vanishes why so being gone i am a man again pray you sit still 

you have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting with most admired disorder 

can such things be and overcome us like a summer's cloud without our special wonder you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe when now i think you can behold such sights and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine is blanched with fear 

what sights my lord

first witch

scene vi forres the palace 

enter lennox and another lord

my former speeches have but hit your thoughts which can interpret further only i say things have been strangely borne the gracious duncan was pitied of macbeth marry he was dead and the right valiant banquo walk'd too late whom you may say if't please you fleance kill'd for fleance fled men must not walk too late who cannot want the thought how monstrous it was for malcolm and for donalbain to kill their gracious father damned fact how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight in pious rage the two delinquents tear that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep was not that nobly done ay and wisely too for twould have anger'd any heart alive to hear the men deny't so that i say he has borne all things well and i do think that had he duncan's sons under his key as an't please heaven he shall not they should find what twere to kill a father so should fleance but peace for from broad words and cause he fail'd his presence at the tyrant's feast i hear macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell where he bestows himself 

lord

the son of duncan from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth lives in the english court and is received of the most pious edward with such grace that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect thither macduff is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid to wake northumberland and warlike siward that by the help of these with him above to ratify the work we may again give to our tables meat sleep to our nights free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives do faithful homage and receive free honours all which we pine for now and this report hath so exasperate the king that he prepares for some attempt of war 

sent he to macduff 

lord

he did and with an absolute sir not i the cloudy messenger turns me his back and hums as who should say you'll rue the time that clogs me with this answer 

and that well might advise him to a caution to hold what distance his wisdom can provide some holy angel fly to the court of england and unfold his message ere he come that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accursed 

lord

i'll send my prayers with him

scene ii fife macduff's castle 

enter lady macduff her son and ross

what had he done to make him fly the land 

you must have patience madam 

he had none his flight was madness when our actions do not our fears do make us traitors 

you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear 

wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes his mansion and his titles in a place from whence himself does fly he loves us not he wants the natural touch for the poor wren the most diminutive of birds will fight her young ones in her nest against the owl all is the fear and nothing is the love as little is the wisdom where the flight so runs against all reason 

my dearest coz i pray you school yourself but for your husband he is noble wise judicious and best knows the fits o the season i dare not speak much further but cruel are the times when we are traitors and do not know ourselves when we hold rumour from what we fear yet know not what we fear but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move i take my leave of you shall not be long but i'll be here again things at the worst will cease or else climb upward to what they were before my pretty cousin blessing upon you 

father'd he is and yet he's fatherless 

i am so much a fool should i stay longer it would be my disgrace and your discomfort i take my leave at once 

sirrah your father's dead and what will you do now how will you live 

son

as birds do mother 

what with worms and flies 

son

with what i get i mean and so do they 

poor bird thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime the pitfall nor the gin 

son

why should i mother poor birds they are not set for my father is not dead for all your saying 

yes he is dead how wilt thou do for a father 

son

nay how will you do for a husband 

why i can buy me twenty at any market 

son

then you'll buy em to sell again 

thou speak'st with all thy wit and yet i faith with wit enough for thee 

son

was my father a traitor mother 

ay that he was 

son

what is a traitor 

why one that swears and lies 

son

and be all traitors that do so 

every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged 

son

and must they all be hanged that swear and lie 

every one 

son

who must hang them 

why the honest men 

son

then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them 

now god help thee poor monkey but how wilt thou do for a father 

son

if he were dead you'ld weep for him if you would not it were a good sign that i should quickly have a new father 

poor prattler how thou talk'st enter a messenger

messenger

bless you fair dame i am not to you known though in your state of honour i am perfect i doubt some danger does approach you nearly if you will take a homely man's advice be not found here hence with your little ones to fright you thus methinks i am too savage to do worse to you were fell cruelty which is too nigh your person heaven preserve you i dare abide no longer 

whither should i fly i have done no harm but i remember now i am in this earthly world where to do harm is often laudable to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly why then alas do i put up that womanly defence to say i have done no harm enter murderers what are these faces 

first murderer

where is your husband 

i hope in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him 

first murderer

he's a traitor 

son

thou liest thou shag hair'd villain 

first murderer

what you egg stabbing him young fry of treachery 

son

he has kill'd me mother run away i pray you dies exit lady macduff crying murder exeunt murderers following her

scene iii england before the king's palace 

enter malcolm and macduff

let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty 

let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and like good men bestride our down fall'n birthdom each new morn new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows strike heaven on the face that it resounds as if it felt with scotland and yell'd out like syllable of dolour 

what i believe i'll wail what know believe and what i can redress as i shall find the time to friend i will what you have spoke it may be so perchance this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest you have loved him well he hath not touch'd you yet i am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god 

i am not treacherous 

but macbeth is a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge but i shall crave your pardon that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose angels are bright still though the brightest fell though all things foul would wear the brows of grace yet grace must still look so 

i have lost my hopes 

perchance even there where i did find my doubts why in that rawness left you wife and child those precious motives those strong knots of love without leave taking i pray you let not my jealousies be your dishonours but mine own safeties you may be rightly just whatever i shall think 

bleed bleed poor country great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure for goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou thy wrongs the title is affeer'd fare thee well lord i would not be the villain that thou think'st for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp and the rich east to boot 

be not offended i speak not as in absolute fear of you i think our country sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash is added to her wounds i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands but for all this when i shall tread upon the tyrant's head or wear it on my sword yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before more suffer and more sundry ways than ever by him that shall succeed 

what should he be 

it is myself i mean in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that when they shall be open'd black macbeth will seem as pure as snow and the poor state esteem him as a lamb being compared with my confineless harms 

not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd in evils to top macbeth 

i grant him bloody luxurious avaricious false deceitful sudden malicious smacking of every sin that has a name but there's no bottom none in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters your matrons and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust and my desire all continent impediments would o'erbear that did oppose my will better macbeth than such an one to reign 

boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink we have willing dames enough there cannot be that vulture in you to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves finding it so inclined 

with this there grows in my most ill composed affection such a stanchless avarice that were i king i should cut off the nobles for their lands desire his jewels and this other's house and my more having would be as a sauce to make me hunger more that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal destroying them for wealth 

this avarice sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root than summer seeming lust and it hath been the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear scotland hath foisons to fill up your will of your mere own all these are portable with other graces weigh'd 

but i have none the king becoming graces as justice verity temperance stableness bounty perseverance mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude i have no relish of them but abound in the division of each several crime acting it many ways nay had i power i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell uproar the universal peace confound all unity on earth 

o scotland scotland 

if such a one be fit to govern speak i am as i have spoken 

fit to govern no not to live o nation miserable with an untitled tyrant bloody scepter'd when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again since that the truest issue of thy throne by his own interdiction stands accursed and does blaspheme his breed thy royal father was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee oftener upon her knees than on her feet died every day she lived fare thee well these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself have banish'd me from scotland o my breast thy hope ends here 

macduff this noble passion child of integrity hath from my soul wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honour devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power and modest wisdom plucks me from over credulous haste but god above deal between thee and me for even now i put myself to thy direction and unspeak mine own detraction here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself for strangers to my nature i am yet unknown to woman never was forsworn scarcely have coveted what was mine own at no time broke my faith would not betray the devil to his fellow and delight no less in truth than life my first false speaking was this upon myself what i am truly is thine and my poor country's to command whither indeed before thy here approach old siward with ten thousand warlike men already at a point was setting forth now we'll together and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel why are you silent 

such welcome and unwelcome things at once tis hard to reconcile enter a doctor

well more anon comes the king forth i pray you 

doctor

ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls that stay his cure their malady convinces the great assay of art but at his touch such sanctity hath heaven given his hand they presently amend 

i thank you doctor exit doctor

what's the disease he means 

'tis call'd the evil a most miraculous work in this good king which often since my here remain in england i have seen him do how he solicits heaven himself best knows but strangely visited people all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye the mere despair of surgery he cures hanging a golden stamp about their necks put on with holy prayers and tis spoken to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction with this strange virtue he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy and sundry blessings hang about his throne that speak him full of grace enter ross

see who comes here 

my countryman but yet i know him not 

my ever gentle cousin welcome hither 

i know him now good god betimes remove the means that makes us strangers 

sir amen 

stands scotland where it did 

alas poor country almost afraid to know itself it cannot be call'd our mother but our grave where nothing but who knows nothing is once seen to smile where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy the dead man's knell is there scarce ask'd for who and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps dying or ere they sicken 

o relation too nice and yet too true 

what's the newest grief 

that of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker each minute teems a new one 

how does my wife 

why well 

and all my children 

well too 

the tyrant has not batter'd at their peace 

no they were well at peace when i did leave em 

but not a niggard of your speech how goes't 

when i came hither to transport the tidings which i have heavily borne there ran a rumour of many worthy fellows that were out which was to my belief witness'd the rather for that i saw the tyrant's power a foot now is the time of help your eye in scotland would create soldiers make our women fight to doff their dire distresses 

be't their comfort we are coming thither gracious england hath lent us good siward and ten thousand men an older and a better soldier none that christendom gives out 

would i could answer this comfort with the like but i have words that would be howl'd out in the desert air where hearing should not latch them 

what concern they the general cause or is it a fee grief due to some single breast 

no mind that's honest but in it shares some woe though the main part pertains to you alone 

if it be mine keep it not from me quickly let me have it 

let not your ears despise my tongue for ever which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard 

hum i guess at it 

your castle is surprised your wife and babes savagely slaughter'd to relate the manner were on the quarry of these murder'd deer to add the death of you 

merciful heaven what man ne'er pull your hat upon your brows give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the o'er fraught heart and bids it break 

my children too 

wife children servants all that could be found 

and i must be from thence my wife kill'd too 

i have said 

be comforted let's make us medicines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief 

he has no children all my pretty ones did you say all o hell kite all what all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop 

dispute it like a man 

i shall do so but i must also feel it as a man i cannot but remember such things were that were most precious to me did heaven look on and would not take their part sinful macduff they were all struck for thee naught that i am not for their own demerits but for mine fell slaughter on their souls heaven rest them now 

be this the whetstone of your sword let grief convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it 

o i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue but gentle heavens cut short all intermission front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself within my sword's length set him if he scape heaven forgive him too 

this tune goes manly come go we to the king our power is ready our lack is nothing but our leave macbeth is ripe for shaking and the powers above put on their instruments receive what cheer you may the night is long that never finds the day

gentlewoman

since his majesty went into the field i have seen her rise from her bed throw her night gown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upon't read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep 

doctor

gentlewoman

doctor

gentlewoman

it is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands i have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour

doctor

gentlewoman

here's the smell of the blood still all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand oh oh oh 

doctor

what a sigh is there the heart is sorely charged 

gentlewoman

i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body 

doctor

well well well 

gentlewoman

pray god it be sir 

doctor

this disease is beyond my practise yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds 

wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so pale i tell you yet again banquo's buried he cannot come out on's grave 

doctor

to bed to bed there's knocking at the gate come come come come give me your hand what's done cannot be undone to bed to bed to bed 

doctor

gentlewoman

doctor

foul whisperings are abroad unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles infected minds to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets more needs she the divine than the physician god god forgive us all look after her remove from her the means of all annoyance and still keep eyes upon her so good night my mind she has mated and amazed my sight i think but dare not speak 

gentlewoman

good night good doctor

the english power is near led on by malcolm his uncle siward and the good macduff revenges burn in them for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm excite the mortified man 

near birnam wood shall we well meet them that way are they coming 

who knows if donalbain be with his brother 

for certain sir he is not i have a file of all the gentry there is siward's son and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood 

what does the tyrant 

great dunsinane he strongly fortifies some say he's mad others that lesser hate him do call it valiant fury but for certain he cannot buckle his distemper'd cause within the belt of rule 

now does he feel his secret murders sticking on his hands now minutely revolts upbraid his faith breach those he commands move only in command nothing in love now does he feel his title hang loose about him like a giant's robe upon a dwarfish thief 

who then shall blame his pester'd senses to recoil and start when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there 

well march we on to give obedience where tis truly owed meet we the medicine of the sickly weal and with him pour we in our country's purge each drop of us 

or so much as it needs to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds make we our march towards birnam exeunt marching

'tis not needed yet 

i'll put it on send out more horses skirr the country round hang those that talk of fear give me mine armour how does your patient doctor 

doctor

not so sick my lord as she is troubled with thick coming fancies that keep her from her rest 

cure her of that canst thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart 

doctor

therein the patient must minister to himself 

throw physic to the dogs i'll none of it come put mine armour on give me my staff seyton send out doctor the thanes fly from me come sir dispatch if thou couldst doctor cast the water of my land find her disease and purge it to a sound and pristine health i would applaud thee to the very echo that should applaud again pull't off i say what rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug would scour these english hence hear'st thou of them 

doctor

scene iv country near birnam wood 

drum and colours enter malcolm siward and young siward macduff menteith caithness angus lennox ross and soldiers marching

cousins i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe 

we doubt it nothing 

what wood is this before us 

the wood of birnam 

let every soldier hew him down a bough and bear't before him thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us 

soldiers

it shall be done 

we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dunsinane and will endure our setting down before t 

'tis his main hope for where there is advantage to be given both more and less have given him the revolt and none serve with him but constrained things whose hearts are absent too 

let our just censures attend the true event and put we on industrious soldiership 

the time approaches that will with due decision make us know what we shall say we have and what we owe thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate but certain issue strokes must arbitrate towards which advance the war exeunt marching

scene v dunsinane within the castle 

enter macbeth seyton and soldiers with drum and colours

hang out our banners on the outward walls the cry is still they come our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up were they not forced with those that should be ours we might have met them dareful beard to beard and beat them backward home a cry of women within what is that noise 

it is the cry of women my good lord 

i have almost forgot the taste of fears the time has been my senses would have cool'd to hear a night shriek and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in't i have supp'd full with horrors direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me re enter seyton wherefore was that cry 

the queen my lord is dead 

she should have died hereafter there would have been a time for such a word to morrow and to morrow and to morrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death out out brief candle life's but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing enter a messenger thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quickly 

messenger

gracious my lord i should report that which i say i saw but know not how to do it 

well say sir 

messenger

as i did stand my watch upon the hill i look'd toward birnam and anon methought the wood began to move 

liar and slave 

messenger

let me endure your wrath if't be not so within this three mile may you see it coming i say a moving grove 

if thou speak'st false upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth i care not if thou dost for me as much i pull in resolution and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth fear not till birnam wood do come to dunsinane and now a wood comes toward dunsinane arm arm and out if this which he avouches does appear there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here i gin to be aweary of the sun and wish the estate o the world were now undone ring the alarum bell blow wind come wrack at least we'll die with harness on our back 

scene vi dunsinane before the castle 

drum and colours enter malcolm siward macduff and their army with boughs

now near enough your leafy screens throw down and show like those you are you worthy uncle shall with my cousin your right noble son lead our first battle worthy macduff and we shall take upon s what else remains to do according to our order 

fare you well do we but find the tyrant's power to night let us be beaten if we cannot fight 

make all our trumpets speak give them all breath those clamorous harbingers of blood and death 

scene vii another part of the field 

alarums enter macbeth

they have tied me to a stake i cannot fly but bear like i must fight the course what's he that was not born of woman such a one am i to fear or none enter young siward

what is thy name 

thou'lt be afraid to hear it 

no though thou call'st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell 

my name's macbeth 

the devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear 

no nor more fearful 

thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword i'll prove the lie thou speak'st they fight and young siward is slain

thou wast born of woman but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorn brandish'd by man that's of a woman born alarums enter macduff

that way the noise is tyrant show thy face if thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still i cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms are hired to bear their staves either thou macbeth or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge i sheathe again undeeded there thou shouldst be by this great clatter one of greatest note seems bruited let me find him fortune and more i beg not exit alarums enter malcolm and siward

this way my lord the castle's gently render'd the tyrant's people on both sides do fight the noble thanes do bravely in the war the day almost itself professes yours and little is to do 

we have met with foes that strike beside us

scene viii another part of the field 

enter macbeth

why should i play the roman fool and die on mine own sword whiles i see lives the gashes do better upon them enter macduff

turn hell hound turn 

of all men else i have avoided thee but get thee back my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already 

i have no words my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out they fight

thou losest labour as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests i bear a charmed life which must not yield to one of woman born 

despair thy charm and let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd 

accursed be that tongue that tells me so for it hath cow'd my better part of man and be these juggling fiends no more believed that palter with us in a double sense that keep the word of promise to our ear and break it to our hope i'll not fight with thee 

then yield thee coward and live to be the show and gaze o the time we'll have thee as our rarer monsters are painted on a pole and underwrit here may you see the tyrant 

i will not yield to kiss the ground before young malcolm's feet and to be baited with the rabble's curse though birnam wood be come to dunsinane and thou opposed being of no woman born yet i will try the last before my body i throw my warlike shield lay on macduff and damn'd be him that first cries hold enough exeunt fighting alarums retreat flourish enter with drum and colours malcolm siward ross the other thanes and soldiers

i would the friends we miss were safe arrived 

some must go off and yet by these i see so great a day as this is cheaply bought 

macduff is missing and your noble son 

your son my lord has paid a soldier's debt he only lived but till he was a man the which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd in the unshrinking station where he fought but like a man he died 

then he is dead 

ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth for then it hath no end 

had he his hurts before 

ay on the front 

why then god's soldier be he had i as many sons as i have hairs i would not wish them to a fairer death and so his knell is knoll'd 

he's worth more sorrow and that i'll spend for him 

he's worth no more they say he parted well and paid his score and so god be with him here comes newer comfort re enter macduff with macbeth's head

hail king for so thou art behold where stands the usurper's cursed head the time is free i see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl that speak my salutation in their minds whose voices i desire aloud with mine hail king of scotland 

hail king of scotland flourish

we shall not spend a large expense of time before we reckon with your several loves and make us even with you my thanes and kinsmen henceforth be earls the first that ever scotland in such an honour named what's more to do which would be planted newly with the time as calling home our exiled friends abroad that fled the snares of watchful tyranny producing forth the cruel ministers of this dead butcher and his fiend like queen who as tis thought by self and violent hands took off her life this and what needful else that calls upon us by the grace of grace we will perform in measure time and place so thanks to all at once and to each one whom we invite to see us crown'd at scone flourish exeunt
