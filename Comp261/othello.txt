othello the moore of venice

scene i venice a street 

enter roderigo and iago

tush never tell me i take it much unkindly that thou iago who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this 

'sblood but you will not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me 

thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate 

despise me if i do not three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant off capp'd to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuff'd with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer and what was he forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practise is all his soldiership but he sir had the election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christian and heathen must be be lee'd and calm'd by debitor and creditor this counter caster he in good time must his lieutenant be and i god bless the mark his moorship's ancient 

by heaven i rather would have been his hangman 

why there's no remedy tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to the first now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor 

i would not follow him then 

o sir content you i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly follow'd you shall mark many a duteous and knee crooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his master's ass for nought but provender and when he's old cashier'd whip me such honest knaves others there are who trimm'd in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in compliment extern tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am 

what a full fortune does the thicklips owe if he can carry't thus 

call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such changes of vexation on't as it may lose some colour 

here is her father's house i'll call aloud 

do with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence the fire is spied in populous cities 

what ho brabantio signior brabantio ho 

awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves thieves look to your house your daughter and your bags thieves thieves brabantio appears above at a window

what is the reason of this terrible summons what is the matter there 

signior is all your family within 

are your doors lock'd 

why wherefore ask you this 

'zounds sir you're robb'd for shame put on your gown your heart is burst you have lost half your soul even now now very now an old black ram is topping your white ewe arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say 

what have you lost your wits 

most reverend signior do you know my voice 

not i what are you 

my name is roderigo 

the worser welcome i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee and now in madness being full of supper and distempering draughts upon malicious bravery dost thou come to start my quiet 

sir sir sir 

but thou must needs be sure my spirit and my place have in them power to make this bitter to thee 

patience good sir 

what tell'st thou me of robbing this is venice my house is not a grange 

most grave brabantio in simple and pure soul i come to you 

'zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you'll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse you'll have your nephews neigh to you you'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans 

what profane wretch art thou 

i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs 

thou art a villain 

you are a senator 

this thou shalt answer i know thee roderigo 

sir i will answer any thing but i beseech you if't be your pleasure and most wise consent as partly i find it is that your fair daughter at this odd even and dull watch o the night transported with no worse nor better guard but with a knave of common hire a gondolier to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor if this be known to you and your allowance we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke do not believe that from the sense of all civility i thus would play and trifle with your reverence your daughter if you have not given her leave i say again hath made a gross revolt tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes in an extravagant and wheeling stranger of here and every where straight satisfy yourself if she be in her chamber or your house let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you 

strike on the tinder ho give me a taper call up all my people this accident is not unlike my dream belief of it oppresses me already light i say light exit above

farewell for i must leave you it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be produced as if i stay i shall against the moor for i do know the state however this may gall him with some cheque cannot with safety cast him for he's embark'd with such loud reason to the cyprus wars which even now stand in act that for their souls another of his fathom they have none to lead their business in which regard though i do hate him as i do hell pains yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the raised search and there will i be with him so farewell enter below brabantio and servants with torches

it is too true an evil gone she is and what's to come of my despised time is nought but bitterness now roderigo where didst thou see her o unhappy girl with the moor say'st thou who would be a father how didst thou know twas she o she deceives me past thought what said she to you get more tapers raise all my kindred are they married think you 

truly i think they are 

o heaven how got she out o treason of the blood fathers from hence trust not your daughters minds by what you see them act is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused have you not read roderigo of some such thing 

yes sir i have indeed 

call up my brother o would you had had her some one way some another do you know where we may apprehend her and the moor 

i think i can discover him if you please to get good guard and go along with me 

pray you lead on at every house i'll call i may command at most get weapons ho and raise some special officers of night on good roderigo i'll deserve your pains 

scene ii another street 

enter othello iago and attendants with torches

though in the trade of war i have slain men yet do i hold it very stuff o the conscience to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs 

'tis better as it is 

nay but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honour that with the little godliness i have i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir are you fast married be assured of this that the magnifico is much beloved and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the duke's he will divorce you or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law with all his might to enforce it on will give him cable 

let him do his spite my services which i have done the signiory shall out tongue his complaints tis yet to know which when i know that boasting is an honour i shall promulgate i fetch my life and being from men of royal siege and my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this that i have reach'd for know iago but that i love the gentle desdemona i would not my unhoused free condition put into circumscription and confine for the sea's worth but look what lights come yond 

those are the raised father and his friends you were best go in 

not i i must be found my parts my title and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly is it they 

by janus i think no enter cassio and certain officers with torches

the servants of the duke and my lieutenant the goodness of the night upon you friends what is the news 

the duke does greet you general and he requires your haste post haste appearance even on the instant 

what is the matter think you 

something from cyprus as i may divine it is a business of some heat the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another's heels and many of the consuls raised and met are at the duke's already you have been hotly call'd for when being not at your lodging to be found the senate hath sent about three several guests to search you out 

'tis well i am found by you i will but spend a word here in the house and go with you 

ancient what makes he here 

'faith he to night hath boarded a land carack if it prove lawful prize he's made for ever 

i do not understand 

he's married 

to who re enter othello

marry to come captain will you go 

have with you 

here comes another troop to seek for you 

it is brabantio general be advised he comes to bad intent enter brabantio roderigo and officers with torches and weapons

holla stand there 

signior it is the moor 

down with him thief they draw on both sides

you roderigo come sir i am for you 

keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them good signior you shall more command with years than with your weapons 

o thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her for i'll refer me to all things of sense if she in chains of magic were not bound whether a maid so tender fair and happy so opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curled darlings of our nation would ever have to incur a general mock run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight judge me the world if tis not gross in sense that thou hast practised on her with foul charms abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weaken motion i'll have't disputed on tis probable and palpable to thinking i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant lay hold upon him if he do resist subdue him at his peril 

hold your hands both you of my inclining and the rest were it my cue to fight i should have known it without a prompter where will you that i go to answer this your charge 

to prison till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer 

what if i do obey how may the duke be therewith satisfied whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him 

first officer

'tis true most worthy signior the duke's in council and your noble self i am sure is sent for 

how the duke in council in this time of the night bring him away mine's not an idle cause the duke himself or any of my brothers of the state cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own for if such actions may have passage free bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be 

scene iii a council chamber 

the duke and senators sitting at a table officers attending

there is no composition in these news that gives them credit 

first senator

indeed they are disproportion'd my letters say a hundred and seven galleys 

and mine a hundred and forty 

second senator

and mine two hundred but though they jump not on a just account as in these cases where the aim reports tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus 

nay it is possible enough to judgment i do not so secure me in the error but the main article i do approve in fearful sense 

sailor

 within what ho what ho what ho 

first officer

a messenger from the galleys enter a sailor

now what's the business 

sailor

the turkish preparation makes for rhodes so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo 

how say you by this change 

first senator

this cannot be by no assay of reason tis a pageant to keep us in false gaze when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk and let ourselves again but understand that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes so may he with more facile question bear it for that it stands not in such warlike brace but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dress'd in if we make thought of this we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first neglecting an attempt of ease and gain to wake and wage a danger profitless 

nay in all confidence he's not for rhodes 

first officer

here is more news enter a messenger

messenger

the ottomites reverend and gracious steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes have there injointed them with an after fleet 

first senator

ay so i thought how many as you guess 

messenger

of thirty sail and now they do restem their backward course bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus signior montano your trusty and most valiant servitor with his free duty recommends you thus and prays you to believe him 

'tis certain then for cyprus marcus luccicos is not he in town 

first senator

he's now in florence 

write from us to him post post haste dispatch 

first senator

here comes brabantio and the valiant moor enter brabantio othello iago roderigo and officers

valiant othello we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman to brabantio i did not see you welcome gentle signior we lack'd your counsel and your help tonight 

so did i yours good your grace pardon me neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so flood gate and o'erbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself 

why what's the matter 

my daughter o my daughter 

senator

dead 

ay to me she is abused stol'n from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so preposterously to err being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not 

whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense yea though our proper son stood in your action 

humbly i thank your grace here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought 

senator

we are very sorry for't 

 to othello what in your own part can you say to this 

nothing but this is so 

most potent grave and reverend signiors my very noble and approved good masters that i have ta'en away this old man's daughter it is most true true i have married her the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech and little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years pith till now some nine moons wasted they have used their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter 

a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blush'd at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit every thing to fall in love with what she fear'd to look on it is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practises of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood or with some dram conjured to this effect he wrought upon her 

to vouch this is no proof without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him 

first senator

but othello speak did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid's affections or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth 

i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagittary and let her speak of me before her father if you do find me foul in her report the trust the office i do hold of you not only take away but let your sentence even fall upon my life 

fetch desdemona hither 

ancient conduct them you best know the place exeunt iago and attendants and till she come as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears i'll present how i did thrive in this fair lady's love and she in mine 

say it othello 

her father loved me oft invited me still question'd me the story of my life from year to year the battles sieges fortunes that i have passed i ran it through even from my boyish days to the very moment that he bade me tell it wherein i spake of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hair breadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my travels history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speak such was the process and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she'ld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer'd my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful she wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd that heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me and bade me if i had a friend that loved her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had pass'd and i loved her that she did pity them this only is the witchcraft i have used here comes the lady let her witness it enter desdemona iago and attendants

i think this tale would win my daughter too good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands 

i pray you hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience 

my noble father i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but here's my husband and so much duty as my mother show'd to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord 

god be wi you i have done please it your grace on to the state affairs i had rather to adopt a child than get it come hither moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keep from thee for your sake jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them i have done my lord 

let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes the robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself that spends a bootless grief 

so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state 

the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition 

the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down i do agnise a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites most humbly therefore bending to your state i crave fit disposition for my wife due reference of place and exhibition with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding 

if you please be't at her father's 

i'll not have it so 

nor i 

nor i i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice to assist my simpleness 

what would you desdemona 

that i did love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart's subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othello's visage in his mind and to his honour and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for which i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him 

let her have your voices vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heat the young affects in me defunct and proper satisfaction but to be free and bounteous to her mind and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me no when light wing'd toys of feather'd cupid seal with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments that my disports corrupt and taint my business let housewives make a skillet of my helm and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation 

be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay or going the affair cries haste and speed must answer it 

first senator

you must away to night 

with all my heart 

at nine i the morning here we'll meet again othello leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you 

so please your grace my ancient a man he is of honest and trust to his conveyance i assign my wife with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me 

let it be so good night to every one to brabantio and noble signior if virtue no delighted beauty lack your son in law is far more fair than black 

first senator

adieu brave moor use desdemona well 

look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father and may thee exeunt duke of venice senators officers and c

my life upon her faith honest iago my desdemona must i leave to thee i prithee let thy wife attend on her and bring them after in the best advantage come desdemona i have but an hour of love of worldly matters and direction to spend with thee we must obey the time exeunt othello and desdemona

iago 

what say'st thou noble heart 

what will i do thinkest thou 

why go to bed and sleep 

i will incontinently drown myself 

if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman 

it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician 

o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon 

what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it 

virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion 

it cannot be 

it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her 

wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue 

thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i re tell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this to morrow adieu 

where shall we meet i the morning 

at my lodging 

i'll be with thee betimes 

go to farewell do you hear roderigo 

what say you 

no more of drowning do you hear 

i am changed i'll go sell all my land 

thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gain'd knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets he has done my office i know not if't be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassio's a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let's see after some time to abuse othello's ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are i have't it is engender'd hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light 

scene i a sea port in cyprus an open place near the quay 

enter montano and two gentlemen

what from the cape can you discern at sea 

first gentleman

nothing at all it is a highwrought flood i cannot twixt the heaven and the main descry a sail 

methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land a fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements if it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them can hold the mortise what shall we hear of this 

second gentleman

a segregation of the turkish fleet for do but stand upon the foaming shore the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds the wind shaked surge with high and monstrous mane seems to cast water on the burning bear and quench the guards of the ever fixed pole i never did like molestation view on the enchafed flood 

if that the turkish fleet be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drown'd it is impossible they bear it out enter a third gentleman

third gentleman

news lads our wars are done the desperate tempest hath so bang'd the turks that their designment halts a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet 

how is this true 

third gentleman

the ship is here put in a veronesa michael cassio lieutenant to the warlike moor othello is come on shore the moor himself at sea and is in full commission here for cyprus 

i am glad on't tis a worthy governor 

third gentleman

but this same cassio though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly and prays the moor be safe for they were parted with foul and violent tempest 

pray heavens he be for i have served him and the man commands like a full soldier let's to the seaside ho as well to see the vessel that's come in as to throw out our eyes for brave othello even till we make the main and the aerial blue an indistinct regard 

third gentleman

come let's do so for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance enter cassio

thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor o let the heavens give him defence against the elements for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea 

is he well shipp'd 

his bark is stoutly timber'd his pilot of very expert and approved allowance therefore my hopes not surfeited to death stand in bold cure a cry within a sail a sail a sail enter a fourth gentleman

what noise 

fourth gentleman

the town is empty on the brow o the sea stand ranks of people and they cry a sail 

my hopes do shape him for the governor guns heard

second gentlemen

they do discharge their shot of courtesy our friends at least 

i pray you sir go forth and give us truth who tis that is arrived 

second gentleman

i shall 

but good lieutenant is your general wived 

most fortunately he hath achieved a maid that paragons description and wild fame one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens and in the essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener re enter second gentleman how now who has put in 

second gentleman

'tis one iago ancient to the general 

has had most favourable and happy speed tempests themselves high seas and howling winds the gutter'd rocks and congregated sands traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel as having sense of beauty do omit their mortal natures letting go safely by the divine desdemona 

what is she 

she that i spake of our great captain's captain left in the conduct of the bold iago whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a se'nnight's speed great jove othello guard and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath that he may bless this bay with his tall ship make love's quick pants in desdemona's arms give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits and bring all cyprus comfort enter desdemona emilia iago roderigo and attendants o behold the riches of the ship is come on shore ye men of cyprus let her have your knees hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven before behind thee and on every hand enwheel thee round 

i thank you valiant cassio what tidings can you tell me of my lord 

he is not yet arrived nor know i aught but that he's well and will be shortly here 

o but i fear how lost you company 

the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship but hark a sail within a sail a sail guns heard

second gentleman

they give their greeting to the citadel this likewise is a friend 

see for the news exit gentleman good ancient you are welcome to emilia welcome mistress let it not gall your patience good iago that i extend my manners tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy kissing her

sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me you'll have enough 

alas she has no speech 

in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking 

you have little cause to say so 

come on come on you are pictures out of doors bells in your parlors wild cats in your kitchens saints m your injuries devils being offended players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds 

o fie upon thee slanderer 

nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work 

you shall not write my praise 

no let me not 

what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me 

o gentle lady do not put me to't for i am nothing if not critical 

come on assay there's one gone to the harbour 

ay madam 

i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise come how wouldst thou praise me 

i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours and thus she is deliver'd if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the one's for use the other useth it 

well praised how if she be black and witty 

if she be black and thereto have a wit she'll find a white that shall her blackness fit 

worse and worse 

how if fair and foolish 

she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly help'd her to an heir 

these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish 

there's none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do 

o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself 

she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lack'd gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being anger'd her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod's head for the salmon's tail she that could think and ne'er disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were 

to do what 

to suckle fools and chronicle small beer 

o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband how say you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor 

he speaks home madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar 

 aside he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster pipes for your sake trumpet within the moor i know his trumpet 

'tis truly so 

let's meet him and receive him 

lo where he comes enter othello and attendants

o my fair warrior 

my dear othello 

it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me o my soul's joy if after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till they have waken'd death and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas olympus high and duck again as low as hell's from heaven if it were now to die twere now to be most happy for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate 

the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow 

amen to that sweet powers i cannot speak enough of this content it stops me here it is too much of joy and this and this the greatest discords be kissing her that e'er our hearts shall make 

 aside o you are well tuned now but i'll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am 

come let us to the castle news friends our wars are done the turks are drown'd how does my old acquaintance of this isle honey you shall be well desired in cyprus i have found great love amongst them o my sweet i prattle out of fashion and i dote in mine own comforts i prithee good iago go to the bay and disembark my coffers bring thou the master to the citadel he is a good one and his worthiness does challenge much respect come desdemona once more well met at cyprus exeunt othello desdemona and attendants

do thou meet me presently at the harbour come hither if thou be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him 

with him why tis not possible 

lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already 

i cannot believe that in her she's full of most blessed condition 

blessed fig's end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that 

yes that i did but that was but courtesy 

lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villanous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you to night for the command i'll lay't upon you cassio knows you not i'll not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister 

well 

sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity 

i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity 

i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell 

adieu 

that cassio loves her i do well believe it that she loves him tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he'll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leap'd into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am even'd with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putting on i'll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my night cap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practising upon his peace and quiet even to madness tis here but yet confused knavery's plain face is never seen tin used 

scene ii a street 

enter a herald with a proclamation people following

herald

it is othello's pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed all offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven heaven bless the isle of cyprus and our noble general othello 

scene iii a hall in the castle 

enter othello desdemona cassio and attendants

good michael look you to the guard to night let's teach ourselves that honourable stop not to outsport discretion 

iago hath direction what to do but notwithstanding with my personal eye will i look to't 

iago is most honest michael good night to morrow with your earliest let me have speech with you to desdemona come my dear love the purchase made the fruits are to ensue that profit's yet to come tween me and you good night exeunt othello desdemona and attendants enter iago

welcome iago we must to the watch 

not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove 

she's a most exquisite lady 

and i'll warrant her fun of game 

indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature 

what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of provocation 

an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest 

and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love 

she is indeed perfection 

well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello 

not to night good iago i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment 

o they are our friends but one cup i'll drink for you 

i have drunk but one cup to night and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more 

what man tis a night of revels the gallants desire it 

where are they 

here at the door i pray you call them in 

i'll do't but it dislikes me 

if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk to night already he'll be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress dog now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath to night caroused potations pottle deep and he's to watch three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honours in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i to night fluster'd with flowing cups and they watch too now mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle but here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream re enter cassio with him montano and gentlemen servants following with wine

'fore god they have given me a rouse already 

good faith a little one not past a pint as i am a soldier 

some wine ho sings and let me the canakin clink clink and let me the canakin clink a soldier's a man a life's but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys 

'fore god an excellent song 

i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander drink ho are nothing to your english 

is your englishman so expert in his drinking 

why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled 

to the health of our general 

i am for it lieutenant and i'll do you justice 

o sweet england king stephen was a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he call'd the tailor lown he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree tis pride that pulls the country down then take thine auld cloak about thee some wine ho 

why this is a more exquisite song than the other 

will you hear't again 

no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things well god's above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved 

it's true good lieutenant 

for mine own part no offence to the general nor any man of quality i hope to be saved 

and so do i too lieutenant 

ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient let's have no more of this let's to our affairs forgive us our sins gentlemen let's look to our business do not think gentlemen i am drunk this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left i am not drunk now i can stand well enough and speak well enough 

all

excellent well 

why very well then you must not think then that i am drunk 

to the platform masters come let's set the watch 

you see this fellow that is gone before he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as the other tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island 

but is he often thus 

'tis evermore the prologue to his sleep he'll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle 

it were well the general were put in mind of it perhaps he sees it not or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio and looks not on his evils is not this true enter roderigo

 aside to him how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go exit roderigo

and tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor 

not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil but hark what noise cry within help help re enter cassio driving in roderigo

you rogue you rascal 

what's the matter lieutenant 

a knave teach me my duty i'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle 

beat me 

dost thou prate rogue striking roderigo

nay good lieutenant staying him i pray you sir hold your hand 

let me go sir or i'll knock you o'er the mazzard 

come come you're drunk 

drunk they fight

 aside to roderigo away i say go out and cry a mutiny exit roderigo nay good lieutenant alas gentlemen help ho lieutenant sir montano sir help masters here's a goodly watch indeed bell rings who's that which rings the bell diablo ho the town will rise god's will lieutenant hold you will be shamed for ever re enter othello and attendants

what is the matter here 

'zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death faints

hold for your lives 

hold ho lieutenant sir montano gentlemen have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame 

why how now ho from whence ariseth this are we turn'd turks and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light he dies upon his motion silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety what is the matter masters honest iago that look'st dead with grieving speak who began this on thy love i charge thee 

i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at other's breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it 

how comes it michael you are thus forgot 

i pray you pardon me i cannot speak 

worthy montano you were wont be civil the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure what's the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night brawler give me answer to it 

worthy othello i am hurt to danger your officer iago can inform you while i spare speech which something now offends me of all that i do know nor know i aught by me that's said or done amiss this night unless self charity be sometimes a vice and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us 

now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgment collied assays to lead the way if i once stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approved in this offence though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth shall lose me what in a town of war yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety tis monstrous iago who began't 

if partially affined or leagued in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier 

touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamour as it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i return'd the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till to night i ne'er might say before when i came back for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass 

i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i love thee but never more be officer of mine re enter desdemona attended look if my gentle love be not raised up i'll make thee an example 

what's the matter 

all's well now sweeting come away to bed sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon lead him off to montano who is led off iago look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted come desdemona tis the soldiers life to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife exeunt all but iago and cassio

what are you hurt lieutenant 

ay past all surgery 

marry heaven forbid 

reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation 

as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he's yours 

i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one's own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil 

what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you 

i know not 

is't possible 

i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts 

why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered 

it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself 

come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good 

i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil 

come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you 

i have well approved it sir i drunk 

you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i'll tell you what you shall do our general's wife is now the general may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before 

you advise me well 

i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness 

i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here 

you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago 

and what's he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she's framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were't to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetter'd to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortunes and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i'll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body's lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all re enter roderigo how now roderigo 

i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i have been to night exceedingly well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice 

how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time does't not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress i'll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay that's the way dull not device by coldness and delay 

scene i before the castle 

enter cassio and some musicians

masters play here i will content your pains something that's brief and bid good morrow general music enter clown

clown

why masters have your instruments been in naples that they speak i the nose thus 

first musician

how sir how 

clown

are these i pray you wind instruments 

first musician

ay marry are they sir 

clown

o thereby hangs a tail 

first musician

whereby hangs a tale sir 

clown

marry sir by many a wind instrument that i know but masters here's money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for love's sake to make no more noise with it 

first musician

well sir we will not 

clown

if you have any music that may not be heard to't again but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care 

first musician

we have none such sir 

clown

then put up your pipes in your bag for i'll away go vanish into air away exeunt musicians

dost thou hear my honest friend 

clown

no i hear not your honest friend i hear you 

prithee keep up thy quillets there's a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring tell her there's one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech wilt thou do this 

clown

she is stirring sir if she will stir hither i shall seem to notify unto her 

do good my friend exit clown enter iago in happy time iago 

you have not been a bed then 

why no the day had broke before we parted i have made bold iago to send in to your wife my suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access 

i'll send her to you presently and i'll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free 

i humbly thank you for't exit iago i never knew a florentine more kind and honest enter emilia

good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasure but all will sure be well the general and his wife are talking of it and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again 

yet i beseech you if you think fit or that it may be done give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone 

pray you come in i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely 

i am much bound to you 

scene ii a room in the castle 

enter othello iago and gentlemen

these letters give iago to the pilot and by him do my duties to the senate that done i will be walking on the works repair there to me 

well my good lord i'll do't 

this fortification gentlemen shall we see't 

gentleman

we'll wait upon your lordship 

scene iii the garden of the castle 

enter desdemona cassio and emilia

be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf 

good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband as if the case were his 

o that's an honest fellow do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were 

bounteous madam whatever shall become of michael cassio he's never any thing but your true servant 

i know't i thank you you do love my lord you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no further off than in a polite distance 

ay but lady that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstance that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service 

do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship i'll perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift i'll intermingle every thing he does with cassio's suit therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away 

madam here comes my lord 

madam i'll take my leave 

why stay and hear me speak 

madam not now i am very ill at ease unfit for mine own purposes 

well do your discretion exit cassio enter othello and iago

ha i like not that 

what dost thou say 

nothing my lord or if i know not what 

was not that cassio parted from my wife 

cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guilty like seeing you coming 

i do believe twas he 

how now my lord i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure 

who is't you mean 

why your lieutenant cassio good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee call him back 

went he hence now 

ay sooth so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him good love call him back 

not now sweet desdemona some other time 

but shall't be shortly 

the sooner sweet for you 

shall't be to night at supper 

no not to night 

to morrow dinner then 

i shall not dine at home i meet the captains at the citadel 

why then to morrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith he's penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason save that they say the wars must make examples out of their best is not almost a fault to incur a private cheque when shall he come tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mammering on what michael cassio that came a wooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath ta'en your part to have so much to do to bring him in trust me i could do much 

prithee no more let him come when he will i will deny thee nothing 

why this is not a boon tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted 

i will deny thee nothing whereon i do beseech thee grant me this to leave me but a little to myself 

shall i deny you no farewell my lord 

farewell my desdemona i'll come to thee straight 

emilia come be as your fancies teach you whate'er you be i am obedient exeunt desdemona and emilia

excellent wretch perdition catch my soul but i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again 

my noble lord 

what dost thou say iago 

did michael cassio when you woo'd my lady know of your love 

he did from first to last why dost thou ask 

but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm 

why of thy thought iago 

i did not think he had been acquainted with her 

o yes and went between us very oft 

indeed 

indeed ay indeed discern'st thou aught in that is he not honest 

honest my lord 

honest ay honest 

my lord for aught i know 

what dost thou think 

think my lord 

think my lord by heaven he echoes me as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou likedst not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought 

my lord you know i love you 

i think thou dost and for i know thou'rt full of love and honesty and weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man that's just they are close delations working from the heart that passion cannot rule 

for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest 

i think so too 

men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none 

certain men should be what they seem 

why then i think cassio's an honest man 

nay yet there's more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words 

good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false as where's that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law days and in session sit with meditations lawful 

thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear a stranger to thy thoughts 

i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess as i confess it is my nature's plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts 

what dost thou mean 

good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed 

by heaven i'll know thy thoughts 

you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst tis in my custody 

ha 

o beware my lord of jealousy it is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damned minutes tells he o'er who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves 

o misery 

poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy 

why why is this think'st thou i'ld make a lie of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago i'll see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy 

i am glad of it for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of self bounty be abused look to't i know our country disposition well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown 

dost thou say so 

she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks she loved them most 

and so she did 

why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seal her father's eyes up close as oak he thought twas witchcraft but i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you 

i am bound to thee for ever 

i see this hath a little dash'd your spirits 

not a jot not a jot 

i faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see you're moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion 

i will not 

should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassio's my worthy friend my lord i see you're moved 

no not much moved i do not think but desdemona's honest 

long live she so and long live you to think so 

and yet how nature erring from itself 

ay there's the point as to be bold with you not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent 

farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago 

 going my lord i take my leave 

why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds 

 returning my lord i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place for sure he fills it up with great ability yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the mean time let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free i do beseech your honour 

fear not my government 

i once more take my leave 

this fellow's of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learned spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings i'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind to pray at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of years yet that's not much she's gone i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapour of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others uses yet tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken desdemona comes re enter desdemona and emilia if she be false o then heaven mocks itself i'll not believe't 

how now my dear othello your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence 

i am to blame 

why do you speak so faintly are you not well 

i have a pain upon my forehead here 

'faith that's with watching twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well 

your napkin is too little he puts the handkerchief from him and it drops let it alone come i'll go in with you 

i am very sorry that you are not well exeunt othello and desdemona

i am glad i have found this napkin this was her first remembrance from the moor my wayward husband hath a hundred times woo'd me to steal it but she so loves the token for he conjured her she should ever keep it that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to i'll have the work ta'en out and give't iago what he will do with it heaven knows not i i nothing but to please his fantasy re enter iago

how now what do you here alone 

do not you chide i have a thing for you 

a thing for me it is a common thing 

ha 

to have a foolish wife 

o is that all what will you give me now for the same handkerchief 

what handkerchief 

what handkerchief why that the moor first gave to desdemona that which so often you did bid me steal 

hast stol'n it from her 

no faith she let it drop by negligence and to the advantage i being here took't up look here it is 

a good wench give it me 

what will you do with t that you have been so earnest to have me filch it 

 snatching it why what's that to you 

if it be not for some purpose of import give't me again poor lady she'll run mad when she shall lack it 

be not acknown on t i have use for it go leave me exit emilia i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin and let him find it trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so look where he comes re enter othello not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday 

ha ha false to me 

why how now general no more of that 

avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack i swear tis better to be much abused than but to know't a little 

how now my lord 

what sense had i of her stol'n hours of lust i saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me i slept the next night well was free and merry i found not cassio's kisses on her lips he that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'n let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all 

i am sorry to hear this 

i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now for ever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spirit stirring drum the ear piercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats the immortal jove's dead clamours counterfeit farewell othello's occupation's gone 

is't possible my lord 

villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of man's eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath 

is't come to this 

make me to see't or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life 

my noble lord 

if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horror's head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that 

o grace o heaven forgive me are you a man have you a soul or sense god be wi you take mine office o wretched fool that livest to make thine honesty a vice o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe i thank you for this profit and from hence i'll love no friend sith love breeds such offence 

nay stay thou shouldst be honest 

i should be wise for honesty's a fool and loses that it works for 

by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not i'll have some proof her name that was as fresh as dian's visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams i'll not endure it would i were satisfied 

i see sir you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied 

would nay i will 

and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her topp'd 

death and damnation o 

it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say where's satisfaction it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you may have't 

give me a living reason she's disloyal 

i do not like the office but sith i am enter'd in this cause so far prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard as if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd and then cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor 

o monstrous monstrous 

nay this was but his dream 

but this denoted a foregone conclusion tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream 

and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly 

i'll tear her all to pieces 

nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand 

i gave her such a one twas my first gift 

i know not that but such a handkerchief i am sure it was your wife's did i to day see cassio wipe his beard with 

if it be that 

if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs 

o that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge now do i see tis true look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven tis gone arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught for tis of aspics tongues 

yet be content 

o blood blood blood 

patience i say your mind perhaps may change 

never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up now by yond marble heaven kneels in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words 

do not rise yet kneels witness you ever burning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wrong'd othello's service let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever they rise

i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee to't within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio's not alive 

my friend is dead tis done at your request but let her live 

damn her lewd minx o damn her come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant 

i am your own for ever 

scene iv before the castle 

enter desdemona emilia and clown

do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies 

clown

i dare not say he lies any where 

why man 

clown

he's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing 

go to where lodges he 

clown

to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie 

can any thing be made of this 

clown

i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat 

can you inquire him out and be edified by report 

clown

i will catechise the world for him that is make questions and by them answer 

seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well 

clown

to do this is within the compass of man's wit and therefore i will attempt the doing it 

where should i lose that handkerchief emilia 

i know not madam 

believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking 

is he not jealous 

who he i think the sun where he was born drew all such humours from him 

look where he comes 

i will not leave him now till cassio be call'd to him enter othello how is't with you my lord

well my good lady aside o hardness to dissemble how do you desdemona 

well my good lord 

give me your hand this hand is moist my lady 

it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow 

this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot hot and moist this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer much castigation exercise devout for here's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels tis a good hand a frank one 

you may indeed say so for twas that hand that gave away my heart 

a liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is hands not hearts 

i cannot speak of this come now your promise 

what promise chuck 

i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you 

i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me lend me thy handkerchief 

here my lord 

that which i gave you 

i have it not about me 

not 

no indeed my lord 

that is a fault that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love but if she lost it or made gift of it my father's eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she dying gave it me and bid me when my fate would have me wive to give it her i did so and take heed on't make it a darling like your precious eye to lose't or give't away were such perdition as nothing else could match 

is't possible 

'tis true there's magic in the web of it a sibyl that had number'd in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sew'd the work the worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skilful conserved of maidens hearts 

indeed is't true 

most veritable therefore look to't well 

then would to god that i had never seen't 

ha wherefore 

why do you speak so startingly and rash 

is't lost is't gone speak is it out o the way 

heaven bless us 

say you 

it is not lost but what an if it were 

how 

i say it is not lost 

fetch't let me see't 

why so i can sir but i will not now this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you let cassio be received again 

fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives 

come come you'll never meet a more sufficient man 

the handkerchief 

i pray talk me of cassio 

the handkerchief 

a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shared dangers with you 

the handkerchief 

in sooth you are to blame 

away 

is not this man jealous 

i ne'er saw this before sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it 

'tis not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomachs and we all but food to eat us hungerly and when they are full they belch us look you cassio and my husband enter cassio and iago

there is no other way tis she must do't and lo the happiness go and importune her 

how now good cassio what's the news with you 

madam my former suit i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist and be a member of his love whom i with all the office of my heart entirely honour i would not be delay'd if my offence be of such mortal kind that nor my service past nor present sorrows nor purposed merit in futurity can ransom me into his love again but to know so must be my benefit so shall i clothe me in a forced content and shut myself up in some other course to fortune's alms 

alas thrice gentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favour as in humour alter'd so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech you must awhile be patient what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you 

is my lord angry 

he went hence but now and certainly in strange unquietness 

can he be angry i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puff'd his own brother and can he be angry something of moment then i will go meet him there's matter in't indeed if he be angry 

i prithee do so exit iago something sure of state either from venice or some unhatch'd practise made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases men's natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object tis even so for let our finger ache and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had suborn'd the witness and he's indicted falsely 

pray heaven it be state matters as you think and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you 

alas the day i never gave him cause 

but jealous souls will not be answer'd so they are not ever jealous for the cause but jealous for they are jealous tis a monster begot upon itself born on itself 

heaven keep that monster from othello's mind 

lady amen 

i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout if i do find him fit i'll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost 

i humbly thank your ladyship exeunt desdemona and emilia enter bianca

save you friend cassio 

what make you from home how is it with you my most fair bianca i faith sweet love i was coming to your house 

and i was going to your lodging cassio what keep a week away seven days and nights eight score eight hours and lovers absent hours more tedious than the dial eight score times o weary reckoning 

pardon me bianca i have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd but i shall in a more continuate time strike off this score of absence sweet bianca giving her desdemona's handkerchief take me this work out 

o cassio whence came this this is some token from a newer friend to the felt absence now i feel a cause is't come to this well well 

go to woman throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth from whence you have them you are jealous now that this is from some mistress some remembrance no in good troth bianca 

why whose is it 

i know not sweet i found it in my chamber i like the work well ere it be demanded as like enough it will i'ld have it copied take it and do't and leave me for this time 

leave you wherefore 

i do attend here on the general and think it no addition nor my wish to have him see me woman'd 

why i pray you 

not that i love you not 

but that you do not love me i pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night 

'tis but a little way that i can bring you for i attend here but i'll see you soon 

'tis very good i must be circumstanced 

scene i cyprus before the castle 

enter othello and iago

will you think so 

think so iago 

what to kiss in private 

an unauthorized kiss 

or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more not meaning any harm 

naked in bed iago and not mean harm it is hypocrisy against the devil they that mean virtuously and yet do so the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven 

so they do nothing tis a venial slip but if i give my wife a handkerchief 

what then 

why then tis hers my lord and being hers she may i think bestow't on any man 

she is protectress of her honour too may she give that 

her honour is an essence that's not seen they have it very oft that have it not but for the handkerchief 

by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it thou said'st it comes o'er my memory as doth the raven o'er the infected house boding to all he had my handkerchief 

ay what of that 

that's not so good now 

what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong or heard him say as knaves be such abroad who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convinced or supplied them cannot choose but they must blab 

hath he said any thing 

he hath my lord but be you well assured no more than he'll unswear 

what hath he said 

'faith that he did i know not what he did 

what what 

lie 

with her 

with her on her what you will 

lie with her lie on her we say lie on her when they belie her lie with her that's fulsome handkerchief confessions handkerchief to confess and be hanged for his labour first to be hanged and then to confess i tremble at it nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction it is not words that shake me thus pish noses ears and lips is't possible confess handkerchief o devil falls in a trance

work on my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught and many worthy and chaste dames even thus all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord my lord i say othello enter cassio how now cassio 

what's the matter 

my lord is fall'n into an epilepsy this is his second fit he had one yesterday 

rub him about the temples 

no forbear the lethargy must have his quiet course if not he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while he will recover straight when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you exit cassio how is it general have you not hurt your head 

dost thou mock me 

i mock you no by heaven would you would bear your fortune like a man 

a horned man's a monster and a beast 

there's many a beast then in a populous city and many a civil monster 

did he confess it 

good sir be a man think every bearded fellow that's but yoked may draw with you there's millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better o tis the spite of hell the fiend's arch mock to lip a wanton in a secure couch and to suppose her chaste no let me know and knowing what i am i know what she shall be 

o thou art wise tis certain 

stand you awhile apart confine yourself but in a patient list whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief a passion most unsuiting such a man cassio came hither i shifted him away and laid good scuse upon your ecstasy bade him anon return and here speak with me the which he promised do but encave yourself and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face for i will make him tell the tale anew where how how oft how long ago and when he hath and is again to cope your wife i say but mark his gesture marry patience or i shall say you are all in all in spleen and nothing of a man 

dost thou hear iago i will be found most cunning in my patience but dost thou hear most bloody 

that's not amiss but yet keep time in all will you withdraw othello retires now will i question cassio of bianca a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio as tis the strumpet's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one he when he hears of her cannot refrain from the excess of laughter here he comes re enter cassio as he shall smile othello shall go mad and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio's smiles gestures and light behavior quite in the wrong how do you now lieutenant 

the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me 

ply desdemona well and you are sure on't speaking lower now if this suit lay in bianco's power how quickly should you speed 

alas poor caitiff 

look how he laughs already 

i never knew woman love man so 

alas poor rogue i think i faith she loves me 

now he denies it faintly and laughs it out 

do you hear cassio 

now he importunes him to tell it o'er go to well said well said 

she gives it out that you shall marry hey do you intend it 

ha ha ha 

do you triumph roman do you triumph 

i marry her what a customer prithee bear some charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome ha ha ha 

so so so so they laugh that win 

'faith the cry goes that you shall marry her 

prithee say true 

i am a very villain else 

have you scored me well 

this is the monkey's own giving out she is persuaded i will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise 

iago beckons me now he begins the story 

she was here even now she haunts me in every place i was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain venetians and thither comes the bauble and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck 

crying o dear cassio as it were his gesture imports it 

so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls me ha ha ha 

now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber o i see that nose of yours but not that dog i shall throw it to 

well i must leave her company 

before me look where she comes 

'tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one enter bianca what do you mean by this haunting of me 

let the devil and his dam haunt you what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now i was a fine fool to take it i must take out the work a likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there this is some minx's token and i must take out the work there give it your hobby horse wheresoever you had it i'll take out no work on't 

how now my sweet bianca how now how now 

by heaven that should be my handkerchief 

an you'll come to supper to night you may an you will not come when you are next prepared for 

after her after her 

'faith i must she'll rail in the street else 

will you sup there 

'faith i intend so 

well i may chance to see you for i would very fain speak with you 

prithee come will you 

go to say no more exit cassio

 advancing how shall i murder him iago 

did you perceive how he laughed at his vice 

o iago 

and did you see the handkerchief 

was that mine 

yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he hath given it his whore 

i would have him nine years a killing a fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman 

nay you must forget that 

ay let her rot and perish and be damned to night for she shall not live no my heart is turned to stone i strike it and it hurts my hand o the world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks 

nay that's not your way 

hang her i do but say what she is so delicate with her needle an admirable musician o she will sing the savageness out of a bear of so high and plenteous wit and invention 

she's the worse for all this 

o a thousand thousand times and then of so gentle a condition 

ay too gentle 

nay that's certain but yet the pity of it iago o iago the pity of it iago 

if you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody 

i will chop her into messes cuckold me 

o tis foul in her 

with mine officer 

that's fouler 

get me some poison iago this night i'll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again this night iago 

do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated 

good good the justice of it pleases very good 

and for cassio let me be his undertaker you shall hear more by midnight

he did not call he's busy in the paper is there division twixt my lord and cassio 

a most unhappy one i would do much to atone them for the love i bear to cassio

may be the letter moved him for as i think they do command him home deputing cassio in his government 

trust me i am glad on't 

indeed 

my lord 

i am glad to see you mad 

why sweet othello 

 striking her devil 

i have not deserved this 

my lord this would not be believed in venice though i should swear i saw't tis very much make her amends she weeps 

o devil devil if that the earth could teem with woman's tears each drop she falls would prove a crocodile out of my sight 

i will not stay to offend you going

truly an obedient lady i do beseech your lordship call her back 

mistress

is this the noble moor whom our full senate call all in all sufficient is this the nature whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue the shot of accident nor dart of chance could neither graze nor pierce 

he is much changed 

are his wits safe is he not light of brain 

he's that he is i may not breathe my censure what he might be if what he might he is not i would to heaven he were 

what strike his wife 

'faith that was not so well yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst 

is it his use or did the letters work upon his blood and new create this fault 

alas alas it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known you shall observe him and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech do but go after and mark how he continues 

i am sorry that i am deceived in him 

scene ii a room in the castle 

enter othello and emilia

you have seen nothing then 

nor ever heard nor ever did suspect 

yes you have seen cassio and she together 

but then i saw no harm and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them 

what did they never whisper 

never my lord 

nor send you out o the way 

never 

to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing 

never my lord 

that's strange 

i durst my lord to wager she is honest lay down my soul at stake if you think other remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom if any wretch have put this in your head let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse for if she be not honest chaste and true there's no man happy the purest of their wives is foul as slander 

bid her come hither go exit emilia she says enough yet she's a simple bawd that cannot say as much this is a subtle whore a closet lock and key of villanous secrets and yet she'll kneel and pray i have seen her do't enter desdemona with emilia

my lord what is your will 

pray chuck come hither 

what is your pleasure 

let me see your eyes look in my face 

what horrible fancy's this 

 to emilia some of your function mistress leave procreants alone and shut the door cough or cry hem if any body come your mystery your mystery nay dispatch exit emilia

upon my knees what doth your speech import i understand a fury in your words but not the words 

why what art thou 

your wife my lord your true and loyal wife 

come swear it damn thyself lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves should fear to seize thee therefore be double damn'd swear thou art honest 

heaven doth truly know it 

heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell 

to whom my lord with whom how am i false 

o desdemona away away away 

alas the heavy day why do you weep am i the motive of these tears my lord if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back lay not your blame on me if you have lost him why i have lost him too 

had it pleased heaven to try me with affliction had they rain'd all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head steep'd me in poverty to the very lips given to captivity me and my utmost hopes i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but alas to make me a fixed figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at yet could i bear that too well very well but there where i have garner'd up my heart where either i must live or bear no life the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up to be discarded thence or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there patience thou young and rose lipp'd cherubin ay there look grim as hell 

i hope my noble lord esteems me honest 

o ay as summer flies are in the shambles that quicken even with blowing o thou weed who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born 

alas what ignorant sin have i committed 

was this fair paper this most goodly book made to write whore upon what committed committed o thou public commoner i should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty did i but speak thy deeds what committed heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear it what committed impudent strumpet 

by heaven you do me wrong 

are you not a strumpet 

no as i am a christian if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet i am none 

what not a whore 

no as i shall be saved 

is't possible 

o heaven forgive us 

i cry you mercy then i took you for that cunning whore of venice that married with othello raising his voice you mistress that have the office opposite to saint peter and keep the gate of hell re enter emilia you you ay you we have done our course there's money for your pains i pray you turn the key and keep our counsel 

alas what does this gentleman conceive how do you madam how do you my good lady 

'faith half asleep 

good madam what's the matter with my lord 

with who 

why with my lord madam 

who is thy lord 

he that is yours sweet lady 

i have none do not talk to me emilia i cannot weep nor answer have i none but what should go by water prithee tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember and call thy husband hither 

here's a change indeed 

'tis meet i should be used so very meet how have i been behaved that he might stick the small'st opinion on my least misuse re enter emilia with iago

what is your pleasure madam how is't with you 

i cannot tell those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks he might have chid me so for in good faith i am a child to chiding 

what's the matter lady 

alas iago my lord hath so bewhored her thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her as true hearts cannot bear 

am i that name iago 

what name fair lady 

such as she says my lord did say i was 

he call'd her whore a beggar in his drink could not have laid such terms upon his callat 

why did he so 

i do not know i am sure i am none such 

do not weep do not weep alas the day 

hath she forsook so many noble matches her father and her country and her friends to be call'd whore would it not make one weep 

it is my wretched fortune 

beshrew him for't how comes this trick upon him 

nay heaven doth know 

i will be hang'd if some eternal villain some busy and insinuating rogue some cogging cozening slave to get some office have not devised this slander i'll be hang'd else 

fie there is no such man it is impossible 

if any such there be heaven pardon him 

a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones why should he call her whore who keeps her company what place what time what form what likelihood the moor's abused by some most villanous knave some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow o heaven that such companions thou'ldst unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to the west 

speak within door 

o fie upon them some such squire he was that turn'd your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the moor 

you are a fool go to 

o good iago what shall i do to win my lord again good friend go to him for by this light of heaven i know not how i lost him here i kneel if e'er my will did trespass gainst his love either in discourse of thought or actual deed or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense delighted them in any other form or that i do not yet and ever did and ever will though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement love him dearly comfort forswear me unkindness may do much and his unkindness may defeat my life but never taint my love i cannot say whore it does abhor me now i speak the word to do the act that might the addition earn not the world's mass of vanity could make me 

i pray you be content tis but his humour the business of the state does him offence and he does chide with you 

if twere no other 

'tis but so i warrant trumpets within hark how these instruments summon to supper the messengers of venice stay the meat go in and weep not all things shall be well exeunt desdemona and emilia enter roderigo how now roderigo 

i do not find that thou dealest justly with me 

what in the contrary 

every day thou daffest me with some device iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope i will indeed no longer endure it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered 

will you hear me roderigo 

'faith i have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin together 

you charge me most unjustly 

with nought but truth i have wasted myself out of my means the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but i find none 

well go to very well 

very well go to i cannot go to man nor tis not very well nay i think it is scurvy and begin to find myself fobbed in it 

very well 

i tell you tis not very well i will make myself known to desdemona if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you 

you have said now 

ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing 

why now i see there's mettle in thee and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before give me thy hand roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair 

it hath not appeared 

i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment but roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean purpose courage and valour this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life 

well what is it is it within reason and compass 

sir there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello's place 

is that true why then othello and desdemona return again to venice 

o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio 

how do you mean removing of him 

why by making him uncapable of othello's place knocking out his brains 

and that you would have me to do 

ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups to night with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable fortune if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us come stand not amazed at it but go along with me i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him it is now high suppertime and the night grows to waste about it 

i will hear further reason for this 

and you shall be satisfied 

scene iii another room in the castle 

enter othello lodovico desdemona emilia and attendants

i do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further 

o pardon me twill do me good to walk 

madam good night i humbly thank your ladyship 

your honour is most welcome 

will you walk sir o desdemona 

my lord 

get you to bed on the instant i will be returned forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be done 

i will my lord exeunt othello lodovico and attendants

how goes it now he looks gentler than he did 

he says he will return incontinent he hath commanded me to go to bed and bade me to dismiss you 

dismiss me 

it was his bidding therefore good emilia give me my nightly wearing and adieu we must not now displease him 

i would you had never seen him 

so would not i my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns prithee unpin me have grace and favour in them 

i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed 

all's one good faith how foolish are our minds if i do die before thee prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets 

come come you talk 

my mother had a maid call'd barbara she was in love and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her she had a song of willow an old thing twas but it express'd her fortune and she died singing it that song to night will not go from my mind i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbara prithee dispatch 

shall i go fetch your night gown 

no unpin me here this lodovico is a proper man 

a very handsome man 

he speaks well 

i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip 

 singing the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow her hand on her bosom her head on her knee sing willow willow willow the fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans sing willow willow willow her salt tears fell from her and soften'd the stones lay by these singing sing willow willow willow prithee hie thee he'll come anon singing sing all a green willow must be my garland let nobody blame him his scorn i approve nay that's not next hark who is't that knocks 

it's the wind 

 singing i call'd my love false love but what said he then sing willow willow willow if i court moe women you'll couch with moe men so get thee gone good night ate eyes do itch doth that bode weeping 

'tis neither here nor there 

i have heard it said so o these men these men dost thou in conscience think tell me emilia that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind 

there be some such no question 

wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world 

why would not you 

no by this heavenly light 

nor i neither by this heavenly light i might do't as well i the dark 

wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world 

the world's a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice 

in troth i think thou wouldst not 

in troth i think i should and undo't when i had done marry i would not do such a thing for a joint ring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole world why who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch i should venture purgatory for't 

beshrew me if i would do such a wrong for the whole world 

why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right 

i do not think there is any such woman 

yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for but i do think it is their husbands faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite why we have galls and though we have some grace yet have we some revenge let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it that they do when they change us for others is it sport i think it is and doth affection breed it i think it doth is't frailty that thus errs it is so too and have not we affections desires for sport and frailty as men have then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so 

good night good night heaven me such uses send not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend 

scene i cyprus a street

scene ii a bedchamber in the castle desdemona in bed asleep 

a light burning enter othello

it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it to you you chaste stars it is the cause yet i'll not shed her blood nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster yet she must die else she'll betray more men put out the light and then put out the light if i quench thee thou flaming minister i can again thy former light restore should i repent me but once put out thy light thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature i know not where is that promethean heat that can thy light relume when i have pluck'd the rose i cannot give it vital growth again it must needs wither i'll smell it on the tree kissing her ah balmy breath that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword one more one more be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee and love thee after one more and this the last so sweet was ne'er so fatal i must weep but they are cruel tears this sorrow's heavenly it strikes where it doth love she wakes 

who's there othello 

ay desdemona 

will you come to bed my lord 

have you pray'd to night desdemona 

ay my lord 

if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace solicit for it straight 

alas my lord what do you mean by that 

well do it and be brief i will walk by i would not kill thy unprepared spirit no heaven forfend i would not kill thy soul 

talk you of killing 

ay i do 

then heaven have mercy on me 

amen with all my heart 

if you say so i hope you will not kill me 

hum 

and yet i fear you for you are fatal then when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear 

think on thy sins 

they are loves i bear to you 

ay and for that thou diest 

that death's unnatural that kills for loving alas why gnaw you so your nether lip some bloody passion shakes your very frame these are portents but yet i hope i hope they do not point on me 

peace and be still 

i will so what's the matter 

that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee thou gavest to cassio 

no by my life and soul send for the man and ask him 

sweet soul take heed take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed 

ay but not yet to die 

yes presently therefore confess thee freely of thy sin for to deny each article with oath cannot remove nor choke the strong conception that i do groan withal thou art to die 

then lord have mercy on me 

i say amen 

and have you mercy too i never did offend you in my life never loved cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as i might love i never gave him token 

by heaven i saw my handkerchief in's hand o perjured woman thou dost stone my heart and makest me call what i intend to do a murder which i thought a sacrifice i saw the handkerchief 

he found it then i never gave it him send for him hither let him confess a truth 

he hath confess'd 

what my lord 

that he hath used thee 

how unlawfully 

ay 

he will not say so 

no his mouth is stopp'd honest iago hath ta'en order for't 

o my fear interprets what is he dead 

had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all 

alas he is betray'd and i undone 

out strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face 

o banish me my lord but kill me not 

down strumpet 

kill me to morrow let me live to night 

nay if you strive 

but half an hour 

being done there is no pause 

but while i say one prayer 

it is too late he stifles her

 within my lord my lord what ho my lord my lord 

what noise is this not dead not yet quite dead i that am cruel am yet merciful i would not have thee linger in thy pain so so 

 within what ho my lord my lord 

who's there 

 within o good my lord i would speak a word with you 

yes tis emilia by and by she's dead tis like she comes to speak of cassio's death the noise was here ha no more moving still as the grave shall she come in were't good i think she stirs again no what's best to do if she come in she'll sure speak to my wife my wife my wife what wife i have no wife o insupportable o heavy hour methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe should yawn at alteration 

 within i do beseech you that i may speak with you o good my lord 

i had forgot thee o come in emilia soft by and by let me the curtains draw where art thou unlocks the door enter emilia what's the matter with thee now 

o my good lord yonder's foul murders done

it is the very error of the moon she comes more nearer earth than she was wont and makes men mad 

cassio my lord hath kill'd a young venetian call'd roderigo 

roderigo kill'd and cassio kill'd 

no cassio is not kill'd 

not cassio kill'd then murder's out of tune and sweet revenge grows harsh 

o falsely falsely murder'd 

alas what cry is that 

that what 

out and alas that was my lady's voice help help ho help o lady speak again sweet desdemona o sweet mistress speak 

a guiltless death i die 

o who hath done this deed 

nobody i myself farewell commend me to my kind lord o farewell dies

why how should she be murder'd 

alas who knows 

you heard her say herself it was not i 

she said so i must needs report the truth 

she's like a liar gone to burning hell twas i that kill'd her 

o the more angel she and you the blacker devil 

she turn'd to folly and she was a whore 

thou dost belie her and thou art a devil 

she was false as water 

thou art rash as fire to say that she was false o she was heavenly true 

cassio did top her ask thy husband else o i were damn'd beneath all depth in hell but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity thy husband knew it all 

my husband 

thy husband 

that she was false to wedlock 

ay with cassio nay had she been true if heaven would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite i'ld not have sold her for it 

my husband 

ay twas he that told me first an honest man he is and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds 

my husband 

what needs this iteration woman i say thy husband 

o mistress villany hath made mocks with love my husband say that she was false 

he woman i say thy husband dost understand the word my friend thy husband honest honest iago 

if he say so may his pernicious soul rot half a grain a day he lies to the heart she was too fond of her most filthy bargain 

ha 

do thy worst this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven than thou wast worthy her 

peace you were best 

thou hast not half that power to do me harm as i have to be hurt o gull o dolt as ignorant as dirt thou hast done a deed i care not for thy sword i'll make thee known though i lost twenty lives help help ho help the moor hath kill'd my mistress murder murder enter montano gratiano iago and others

what is the matter how now general 

o are you come iago you have done well that men must lay their murders on your neck 

what is the matter 

disprove this villain if thou be'st a man he says thou told'st him that his wife was false i know thou didst not thou'rt not such a villain speak for my heart is full 

i told him what i thought and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true 

but did you ever tell him she was false 

i did 

you told a lie an odious damned lie upon my soul a lie a wicked lie she false with cassio did you say with cassio 

with cassio mistress go to charm your tongue 

i will not charm my tongue i am bound to speak my mistress here lies murder'd in her bed 

all

o heavens forfend 

and your reports have set the murder on 

nay stare not masters it is true indeed 

'tis a strange truth 

o monstrous act

what are you mad i charge you get you home 

good gentlemen let me have leave to speak tis proper i obey him but not now perchance iago i will ne'er go home 

o o o he falls on the bed

nay lay thee down and roar for thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent that e'er did lift up eye 

 rising o she was foul i scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd i know this act shows horrible and grim 

poor desdemona i am glad thy father's dead thy match was mortal to him and pure grief shore his old thread in twain did he live now this sight would make him do a desperate turn yea curse his better angel from his side and fall to reprobation 

'tis pitiful but yet iago knows that she with cassio hath the act of shame a thousand times committed cassio confess'd it and she did gratify his amorous works with that recognizance and pledge of love which i first gave her i saw it in his hand it was a handkerchief an antique token my father gave my mother 

o heaven o heavenly powers 

come hold your peace 

'twill out twill out i peace no i will speak as liberal as the north let heaven and men and devils let them all all all cry shame against me yet i'll speak 

be wise and get you home 

i will not iago offers to stab emilia

fie your sword upon a woman 

o thou dull moor that handkerchief thou speak'st of i found by fortune and did give my husband for often with a solemn earnestness more than indeed belong'd to such a trifle he begg'd of me to steal it 

villanous whore 

she give it cassio no alas i found it and i did give't my husband 

filth thou liest 

by heaven i do not i do not gentlemen o murderous coxcomb what should such a fool do with so good a woman

o thou othello thou wert once so good fall'n in the practise of a damned slave what shall be said to thee 

why any thing an honourable murderer if you will for nought i did in hate but all in honour 

this wretch hath part confess'd his villany did you and he consent in cassio's death 

ay 

dear general i never gave you cause 

i do believe it and i ask your pardon will you i pray demand that demi devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body 

demand me nothing what you know you know from this time forth i never will speak word 

what not to pray 

torments will ope your lips 

well thou dost best 

sir you shall understand what hath befall'n which as i think you know not here is a letter found in the pocket of the slain roderigo and here another the one of them imports the death of cassio to be undertook by roderigo 

o villain 

most heathenish and most gross 

now here's another discontented paper found in his pocket too and this it seems roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain but that belike iago in the interim came in and satisfied him 

o the pernicious caitiff how came you cassio by that handkerchief that was my wife's 

i found it in my chamber and he himself confess'd but even now that there he dropp'd it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire 

o fool fool fool 

there is besides in roderigo's letter how he upbraids iago that he made him brave me upon the watch whereon it came that i was cast and even but now he spake after long seeming dead iago hurt him iago set him on 

you must forsake this room and go with us your power and your command is taken off and cassio rules in cyprus for this slave if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long it shall be his you shall close prisoner rest till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state come bring him away 

soft you a word or two before you go i have done the state some service and they know't no more of that i pray you in your letters when you shall these unlucky deeds relate speak of me as i am nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well of one not easily jealous but being wrought perplex'd in the extreme of one whose hand like the base indian threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes albeit unused to the melting mood drop tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinal gum set you down this and say besides that in aleppo once where a malignant and a turban'd turk beat a venetian and traduced the state i took by the throat the circumcised dog and smote him thus stabs himself

o bloody period 

all that's spoke is marr'd 

i kiss'd thee ere i kill'd thee no way but this killing myself to die upon a kiss falls on the bed and dies

this did i fear but thought he had no weapon for he was great of heart 

 to iago o spartan dog more fell than anguish hunger or the sea look on the tragic loading of this bed this is thy work the object poisons sight let it be hid gratiano keep the house and seize upon the fortunes of the moor for they succeed on you to you lord governor remains the censure of this hellish villain the time the place the torture o enforce it myself will straight aboard and to the state this heavy act with heavy heart relate
