king lear

scene i king lear's palace 

enter kent gloucester and edmund

i thought the king had more affected the duke of albany than cornwall 

it did always seem so to us but now in the division of the kingdom it appears not which of the dukes he values most for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety 

is not this your son my lord 

his breeding sir hath been at my charge i have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now i am brazed to it 

i cannot conceive you 

sir this young fellow's mother could whereupon she grew round wombed and had indeed sir a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed do you smell a fault 

i cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it being so proper 

but i have sir a son by order of law some year elder than this who yet is no dearer in my account though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for yet was his mother fair there was good sport at his making and the whoreson must be acknowledged do you know this noble gentleman edmund 

no my lord 

my lord of kent remember him hereafter as my honourable friend 

my services to your lordship 

i must love you and sue to know you better 

sir i shall study deserving 

he hath been out nine years and away he shall again the king is coming sennet enter king lear cornwall albany goneril regan cordelia and attendants

attend the lords of france and burgundy gloucester 

i shall my liege exeunt gloucester and edmund

meantime we shall express our darker purpose give me the map there know that we have divided in three our kingdom and tis our fast intent to shake all cares and business from our age conferring them on younger strengths while we unburthen'd crawl toward death our son of cornwall and you our no less loving son of albany we have this hour a constant will to publish our daughters several dowers that future strife may be prevented now the princes france and burgundy great rivals in our youngest daughter's love long in our court have made their amorous sojourn and here are to be answer'd tell me my daughters since now we will divest us both of rule interest of territory cares of state which of you shall we say doth love us most that we our largest bounty may extend where nature doth with merit challenge goneril our eldest born speak first 

sir i love you more than words can wield the matter dearer than eye sight space and liberty beyond what can be valued rich or rare no less than life with grace health beauty honour as much as child e'er loved or father found a love that makes breath poor and speech unable beyond all manner of so much i love you 

 aside what shall cordelia do love and be silent 

of all these bounds even from this line to this with shadowy forests and with champains rich'd with plenteous rivers and wide skirted meads we make thee lady to thine and albany's issue be this perpetual what says our second daughter our dearest regan wife to cornwall speak 

sir i am made of the self same metal that my sister is and prize me at her worth in my true heart i find she names my very deed of love only she comes too short that i profess myself an enemy to all other joys which the most precious square of sense possesses and find i am alone felicitate in your dear highness love 

 aside then poor cordelia and yet not so since i am sure my love's more richer than my tongue 

to thee and thine hereditary ever remain this ample third of our fair kingdom no less in space validity and pleasure than that conferr'd on goneril now our joy although the last not least to whose young love the vines of france and milk of burgundy strive to be interess'd what can you say to draw a third more opulent than your sisters speak 

nothing my lord 

nothing 

nothing 

nothing will come of nothing speak again 

unhappy that i am i cannot heave my heart into my mouth i love your majesty according to my bond nor more nor less 

how how cordelia mend your speech a little lest it may mar your fortunes 

good my lord you have begot me bred me loved me i return those duties back as are right fit obey you love you and most honour you why have my sisters husbands if they say they love you all haply when i shall wed that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry half my love with him half my care and duty sure i shall never marry like my sisters to love my father all 

but goes thy heart with this 

ay good my lord 

so young and so untender 

so young my lord and true 

let it be so thy truth then be thy dower for by the sacred radiance of the sun the mysteries of hecate and the night by all the operation of the orbs from whom we do exist and cease to be here i disclaim all my paternal care propinquity and property of blood and as a stranger to my heart and me hold thee from this for ever the barbarous scythian or he that makes his generation messes to gorge his appetite shall to my bosom be as well neighbour'd pitied and relieved as thou my sometime daughter 

good my liege 

peace kent come not between the dragon and his wrath i loved her most and thought to set my rest on her kind nursery hence and avoid my sight so be my grave my peace as here i give her father's heart from her call france who stirs call burgundy cornwall and albany with my two daughters dowers digest this third let pride which she calls plainness marry her i do invest you jointly with my power pre eminence and all the large effects that troop with majesty ourself by monthly course with reservation of an hundred knights by you to be sustain'd shall our abode make with you by due turns only we still retain the name and all the additions to a king the sway revenue execution of the rest beloved sons be yours which to confirm this coronet part betwixt you giving the crown

royal lear whom i have ever honour'd as my king loved as my father as my master follow'd as my great patron thought on in my prayers 

the bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft 

let it fall rather though the fork invade the region of my heart be kent unmannerly when lear is mad what wilt thou do old man think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows to plainness honour's bound when majesty stoops to folly reverse thy doom and in thy best consideration cheque this hideous rashness answer my life my judgment thy youngest daughter does not love thee least nor are those empty hearted whose low sound reverbs no hollowness 

kent on thy life no more 

my life i never held but as a pawn to wage against thy enemies nor fear to lose it thy safety being the motive 

out of my sight 

see better lear and let me still remain the true blank of thine eye 

now by apollo 

now by apollo king thou swear'st thy gods in vain 

o vassal miscreant laying his hand on his sword

cornwall

dear sir forbear 

do kill thy physician and the fee bestow upon thy foul disease revoke thy doom or whilst i can vent clamour from my throat i'll tell thee thou dost evil 

hear me recreant on thine allegiance hear me since thou hast sought to make us break our vow which we durst never yet and with strain'd pride to come between our sentence and our power which nor our nature nor our place can bear our potency made good take thy reward five days we do allot thee for provision to shield thee from diseases of the world and on the sixth to turn thy hated back upon our kingdom if on the tenth day following thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions the moment is thy death away by jupiter this shall not be revoked 

fare thee well king sith thus thou wilt appear freedom lives hence and banishment is here to cordelia the gods to their dear shelter take thee maid that justly think'st and hast most rightly said to regan and goneril and your large speeches may your deeds approve that good effects may spring from words of love thus kent o princes bids you all adieu he'll shape his old course in a country new flourish re enter gloucester with king of france burgundy and attendants

here's france and burgundy my noble lord 

my lord of burgundy we first address towards you who with this king hath rivall'd for our daughter what in the least will you require in present dower with her or cease your quest of love 

most royal majesty i crave no more than what your highness offer'd nor will you tender less 

right noble burgundy when she was dear to us we did hold her so but now her price is fall'n sir there she stands if aught within that little seeming substance or all of it with our displeasure pieced and nothing more may fitly like your grace she's there and she is yours 

i know no answer 

will you with those infirmities she owes unfriended new adopted to our hate dower'd with our curse and stranger'd with our oath take her or leave her 

pardon me royal sir election makes not up on such conditions 

then leave her sir for by the power that made me i tell you all her wealth to king of france for you great king i would not from your love make such a stray to match you where i hate therefore beseech you to avert your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed almost to acknowledge hers 

this is most strange that she that even but now was your best object the argument of your praise balm of your age most best most dearest should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle so many folds of favour sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it or your fore vouch'd affection fall'n into taint which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle could never plant in me 

i yet beseech your majesty if for i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not since what i well intend i'll do't before i speak that you make known it is no vicious blot murder or foulness no unchaste action or dishonour'd step that hath deprived me of your grace and favour but even for want of that for which i am richer a still soliciting eye and such a tongue as i am glad i have not though not to have it hath lost me in your liking 

better thou hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better 

is it but this a tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do my lord of burgundy what say you to the lady love's not love when it is mingled with regards that stand aloof from the entire point will you have her she is herself a dowry 

royal lear give but that portion which yourself proposed and here i take cordelia by the hand duchess of burgundy 

nothing i have sworn i am firm 

i am sorry then you have so lost a father that you must lose a husband 

peace be with burgundy since that respects of fortune are his love i shall not be his wife 

fairest cordelia that art most rich being poor most choice forsaken and most loved despised thee and thy virtues here i seize upon be it lawful i take up what's cast away gods gods tis strange that from their cold'st neglect my love should kindle to inflamed respect thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance is queen of us of ours and our fair france not all the dukes of waterish burgundy can buy this unprized precious maid of me bid them farewell cordelia though unkind thou losest here a better where to find 

thou hast her france let her be thine for we have no such daughter nor shall ever see that face of hers again therefore be gone without our grace our love our benison come noble burgundy flourish exeunt all but king of france goneril regan and cordelia

bid farewell to your sisters 

the jewels of our father with wash'd eyes cordelia leaves you i know you what you are and like a sister am most loath to call your faults as they are named use well our father to your professed bosoms i commit him but yet alas stood i within his grace i would prefer him to a better place so farewell to you both 

prescribe not us our duties 

let your study be to content your lord who hath received you at fortune's alms you have obedience scanted and well are worth the want that you have wanted 

time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides who cover faults at last shame them derides well may you prosper 

come my fair cordelia exeunt king of france and cordelia

sister it is not a little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both i think our father will hence to night 

that's most certain and with you next month with us 

you see how full of changes his age is the observation we have made of it hath not been little he always loved our sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly 

'tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself 

the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look to receive from his age not alone the imperfections of long engraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them 

such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent's banishment 

there is further compliment of leavetaking between france and him pray you let's hit together if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears this last surrender of his will but offend us 

we shall further think on't 

we must do something and i the heat 

scene ii the earl of gloucester's castle 

enter edmund with a letter

thou nature art my goddess to thy law my services are bound wherefore should i stand in the plague of custom and permit the curiosity of nations to deprive me for that i am some twelve or fourteen moon shines lag of a brother why bastard wherefore base when my dimensions are as well compact my mind as generous and my shape as true as honest madam's issue why brand they us with base with baseness bastardy base base who in the lusty stealth of nature take more composition and fierce quality than doth within a dull stale tired bed go to the creating a whole tribe of fops got tween asleep and wake well then legitimate edgar i must have your land our father's love is to the bastard edmund as to the legitimate fine word legitimate well my legitimate if this letter speed and my invention thrive edmund the base shall top the legitimate i grow i prosper now gods stand up for bastards enter gloucester

kent banish'd thus and france in choler parted and the king gone to night subscribed his power confined to exhibition all this done upon the gad edmund how now what news 

so please your lordship none putting up the letter

why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter 

i know no news my lord 

what paper were you reading 

nothing my lord 

no what needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself let's see come if it be nothing i shall not need spectacles 

i beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter from my brother that i have not all o'er read and for so much as i have perused i find it not fit for your o'er looking 

give me the letter sir 

i shall offend either to detain or give it the contents as in part i understand them are to blame 

let's see let's see 

i hope for my brother's justification he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue 

 reads this policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them i begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not as it hath power but as it is suffered come to me that of this i may speak more if our father would sleep till i waked him you should half his revenue for ever and live the beloved of your brother edgar hum conspiracy sleep till i waked him you should enjoy half his revenue my son edgar had he a hand to write this a heart and brain to breed it in when came this to you who brought it 

it was not brought me my lord there's the cunning of it i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet 

you know the character to be your brother's 

if the matter were good my lord i durst swear it were his but in respect of that i would fain think it were not 

it is his 

it is his hand my lord but i hope his heart is not in the contents 

hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business 

never my lord but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age and fathers declining the father should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue 

o villain villain his very opinion in the letter abhorred villain unnatural detested brutish villain worse than brutish go sirrah seek him i'll apprehend him abominable villain where is he 

i do not well know my lord if it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent you shall run a certain course where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience i dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honour and to no further pretence of danger 

think you so 

if your honour judge it meet i will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very evening 

he cannot be such a monster 

nor is not sure 

to his father that so tenderly and entirely loves him heaven and earth edmund seek him out wind me into him i pray you frame the business after your own wisdom i would unstate myself to be in a due resolution 

i will seek him sir presently convey the business as i shall find means and acquaint you withal 

these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects love cools friendship falls off brothers divide in cities mutinies in countries discord in palaces treason and the bond cracked twixt son and father this villain of mine comes under the prediction there's son against father the king falls from bias of nature there's father against child we have seen the best of our time machinations hollowness treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves find out this villain edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it carefully and the noble and true hearted kent banished his offence honesty tis strange 

this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeit of our own behavior we make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if we were villains by necessity fools by heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star my father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail and my nativity was under ursa major so that it follows i am rough and lecherous tut i should have been that i am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing edgar enter edgar and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy my cue is villanous melancholy with a sigh like tom o bedlam o these eclipses do portend these divisions fa sol la mi 

how now brother edmund what serious contemplation are you in 

i am thinking brother of a prediction i read this other day what should follow these eclipses 

do you busy yourself about that 

i promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent death dearth dissolutions of ancient amities divisions in state menaces and maledictions against king and nobles needless diffidences banishment of friends dissipation of cohorts nuptial breaches and i know not what 

how long have you been a sectary astronomical 

come come when saw you my father last 

why the night gone by 

spake you with him 

ay two hours together 

parted you in good terms found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance 

none at all 

bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay 

some villain hath done me wrong 

that's my fear i pray you have a continent forbearance till the spied of his rage goes slower and as i say retire with me to my lodging from whence i will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak pray ye go there's my key if you do stir abroad go armed 

armed brother 

brother i advise you to the best go armed i am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards you i have told you what i have seen and heard but faintly nothing like the image and horror of it pray you away 

shall i hear from you anon 

i do serve you in this business exit edgar a credulous father and a brother noble whose nature is so far from doing harms that he suspects none on whose foolish honesty my practises ride easy i see the business let me if not by birth have lands by wit all with me's meet that i can fashion fit

knight

i beseech you pardon me my lord if i be mistaken for my duty cannot be silent when i think your highness wronged

not only sir this your all licensed fool but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth in rank and not to be endured riots sir i had thought by making this well known unto you to have found a safe redress but now grow fearful by what yourself too late have spoke and done that you protect this course and put it on by your allowance which if you should the fault would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep which in the tender of a wholesome weal might in their working do you that offence which else were shame that then necessity will call discreet proceeding 

fool

your name fair gentlewoman 

this admiration sir is much o the savour of other your new pranks i do beseech you to understand my purposes aright as you are old and reverend you should be wise here do you keep a hundred knights and squires men so disorder'd so debosh'd and bold that this our court infected with their manners shows like a riotous inn epicurism and lust make it more like a tavern or a brothel than a graced palace the shame itself doth speak for instant remedy be then desired by her that else will take the thing she begs a little to disquantity your train and the remainder that shall still depend to be such men as may besort your age and know themselves and you

pray sir be patient 

 to goneril detested kite thou liest my train are men of choice and rarest parts that all particulars of duty know and in the most exact regard support the worships of their name o most small fault how ugly didst thou in cordelia show that like an engine wrench'd my frame of nature from the fix'd place drew from heart all love and added to the gall o lear lear lear beat at this gate that let thy folly in striking his head and thy dear judgment out go go my people 

my lord i am guiltless as i am ignorant of what hath moved you 

it may be so my lord hear nature hear dear goddess hear suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend to make this creature fruitful into her womb convey sterility dry up in her the organs of increase and from her derogate body never spring a babe to honour her if she must teem create her child of spleen that it may live and be a thwart disnatured torment to her let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks turn all her mother's pains and benefits to laughter and contempt that she may feel how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child away away 

now gods that we adore whereof comes this 

never afflict yourself to know the cause but let his disposition have that scope that dotage gives it re enter king lear

what fifty of my followers at a clap within a fortnight 

what's the matter sir 

i'll tell thee to goneril life and death i am ashamed that thou hast power to shake my manhood thus that these hot tears which break from me perforce should make thee worth them blasts and fogs upon thee the untented woundings of a father's curse pierce every sense about thee old fond eyes beweep this cause again i'll pluck ye out and cast you with the waters that you lose to temper clay yea it is come to this let is be so yet have i left a daughter who i am sure is kind and comfortable when she shall hear this of thee with her nails she'll flay thy wolvish visage thou shalt find that i'll resume the shape which thou dost think i have cast off for ever thou shalt i warrant thee exeunt king lear kent and attendants

the messengers from our sister and the king 

what is your difference speak 

i am scarce in breath my lord 

no marvel you have so bestirred your valour you cowardly rascal nature disclaims in thee a tailor made thee 

thou art a strange fellow a tailor make a man 

ay a tailor sir a stone cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though he had been but two hours at the trade 

speak yet how grew your quarrel 

this ancient ruffian sir whose life i have spared at suit of his gray beard 

thou whoreson zed thou unnecessary letter my lord if you will give me leave i will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him spare my gray beard you wagtail 

peace sirrah you beastly knave know you no reverence 

yes sir but anger hath a privilege 

why art thou angry 

that such a slave as this should wear a sword who wears no honesty such smiling rogues as these like rats oft bite the holy cords a twain which are too intrinse t unloose smooth every passion that in the natures of their lords rebel bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks with every gale and vary of their masters knowing nought like dogs but following a plague upon your epileptic visage smile you my speeches as i were a fool goose if i had you upon sarum plain i'ld drive ye cackling home to camelot 

why art thou mad old fellow 

how fell you out say that 

no contraries hold more antipathy than i and such a knave 

why dost thou call him a knave what's his offence 

his countenance likes me not 

no more perchance does mine nor his nor hers 

sir tis my occupation to be plain i have seen better faces in my time than stands on any shoulder that i see before me at this instant 

this is some fellow who having been praised for bluntness doth affect a saucy roughness and constrains the garb quite from his nature he cannot flatter he an honest mind and plain he must speak truth an they will take it so if not he's plain these kind of knaves i know which in this plainness harbour more craft and more corrupter ends than twenty silly ducking observants that stretch their duties nicely 

sir in good sooth in sincere verity under the allowance of your great aspect whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire on flickering phoebus front 

what mean'st by this 

to go out of my dialect which you discommend so much i know sir i am no flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave which for my part i will not be though i should win your displeasure to entreat me to t 

what was the offence you gave him 

i never gave him any it pleased the king his master very late to strike at me upon his misconstruction when he conjunct and flattering his displeasure tripp'd me behind being down insulted rail'd and put upon him such a deal of man that worthied him got praises of the king for him attempting who was self subdued and in the fleshment of this dread exploit drew on me here again 

none of these rogues and cowards but ajax is their fool 

fetch forth the stocks you stubborn ancient knave you reverend braggart we'll teach you 

sir i am too old to learn call not your stocks for me i serve the king on whose employment i was sent to you you shall do small respect show too bold malice against the grace and person of my master stocking his messenger 

fetch forth the stocks as i have life and honour there shall he sit till noon 

till noon till night my lord and all night too 

why madam if i were your father's dog you should not use me so 

sir being his knave i will 

this is a fellow of the self same colour our sister speaks of come bring away the stocks stocks brought out

let me beseech your grace not to do so his fault is much and the good king his master will cheque him for t your purposed low correction is such as basest and contemned'st wretches for pilferings and most common trespasses are punish'd with the king must take it ill that he's so slightly valued in his messenger should have him thus restrain'd 

i'll answer that 

my sister may receive it much more worse to have her gentleman abused assaulted for following her affairs put in his legs kent is put in the stocks come my good lord away exeunt all but gloucester and kent

why not by the hand sir how have i offended all's not offence that indiscretion finds and dotage terms so 

o sides you are too tough will you yet hold how came my man i the stocks 

i set him there sir but his own disorders deserved much less advancement 

you did you 

i pray you father being weak seem so if till the expiration of your month you will return and sojourn with my sister dismissing half your train come then to me i am now from home and out of that provision which shall be needful for your entertainment 

return to her and fifty men dismiss'd no rather i abjure all roofs and choose to wage against the enmity o the air to be a comrade with the wolf and owl necessity's sharp pinch return with her why the hot blooded france that dowerless took our youngest born i could as well be brought to knee his throne and squire like pension beg to keep base life afoot return with her persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter to this detested groom pointing at oswald

at your choice sir 

i prithee daughter do not make me mad i will not trouble thee my child farewell we'll no more meet no more see one another but yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter or rather a disease that's in my flesh which i must needs call mine thou art a boil a plague sore an embossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood but i'll not chide thee let shame come when it will i do not call it i do not bid the thunder bearer shoot nor tell tales of thee to high judging jove mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure i can be patient i can stay with regan i and my hundred knights 

not altogether so i look'd not for you yet nor am provided for your fit welcome give ear sir to my sister for those that mingle reason with your passion must be content to think you old and so but she knows what she does 

is this well spoken

in wisdom i should ask thy name but since thy outside looks so fair and warlike and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes what safe and nicely i might well delay by rule of knighthood i disdain and spurn back do i toss these treasons to thy head with the hell hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise this sword of mine shall give them instant way where they shall rest for ever trumpets speak alarums they fight edmund falls

by nursing them my lord list a brief tale and when tis told o that my heart would burst the bloody proclamation to escape that follow'd me so near o our lives sweetness that we the pain of death would hourly die rather than die at once taught me to shift into a madman's rags to assume a semblance that very dogs disdain'd and in this habit met i my father with his bleeding rings their precious stones new lost became his guide led him begg'd for him saved him from despair never o fault reveal'd myself unto him until some half hour past when i was arm'd not sure though hoping of this good success i ask'd his blessing and from first to last told him my pilgrimage but his flaw'd heart alack too weak the conflict to support twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief burst smilingly 

this speech of yours hath moved me and shall perchance do good but speak you on you look as you had something more to say 

if there be more more woeful hold it in for i am almost ready to dissolve hearing of this 

this would have seem'd a period to such as love not sorrow but another to amplify too much would make much more and top extremity whilst i was big in clamour came there in a man who having seen me in my worst estate shunn'd my abhorr'd society but then finding who twas that so endured with his strong arms he fastened on my neck and bellow'd out as he'ld burst heaven threw him on my father told the most piteous tale of lear and him that ever ear received which in recounting his grief grew puissant and the strings of life began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded and there i left him tranced

did i not fellow i have seen the day with my good biting falchion i would have made them skip i am old now and these same crosses spoil me who are you mine eyes are not o the best i'll tell you straight 

if fortune brag of two she loved and hated one of them we behold 

this is a dull sight are you not kent 

the same your servant kent where is your servant caius 

he's a good fellow i can tell you that he'll strike and quickly too he's dead and rotten 

no my good lord i am the very man 

i'll see that straight 

that from your first of difference and decay have follow'd your sad steps 

you are welcome hither 

nor no man else all's cheerless dark and deadly your eldest daughters have fordone them selves and desperately are dead 

ay so i think 

he knows not what he says and vain it is that we present us to him 

very bootless enter a captain

captain

edmund is dead my lord 

that's but a trifle here you lords and noble friends know our intent what comfort to this great decay may come shall be applied for us we will resign during the life of this old majesty to him our absolute power to edgar and kent you to your rights with boot and such addition as your honours have more than merited all friends shall taste the wages of their virtue and all foes the cup of their deservings o see see 

and my poor fool is hang'd no no no life why should a dog a horse a rat have life and thou no breath at all thou'lt come no more never never never never never pray you undo this button thank you sir do you see this look on her look her lips look there look there dies

he faints my lord my lord 

break heart i prithee break 

look up my lord 

vex not his ghost o let him pass he hates him much that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out longer 

he is gone indeed 

the wonder is he hath endured so long he but usurp'd his life 

bear them from hence our present business is general woe to kent and edgar friends of my soul you twain rule in this realm and the gored state sustain 

i have a journey sir shortly to go my master calls me i must not say no 

the weight of this sad time we must obey speak what we feel not what we ought to say the oldest hath borne most we that are young shall never see so much nor live so long exeunt with a dead march
