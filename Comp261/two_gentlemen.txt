two gentlemen of verona

scene i verona an open place 

enter valentine and proteus

cease to persuade my loving proteus home keeping youth have ever homely wits were't not affection chains thy tender days to the sweet glances of thy honour'd love i rather would entreat thy company to see the wonders of the world abroad than living dully sluggardized at home wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness but since thou lovest love still and thrive therein even as i would when i to love begin 

wilt thou be gone sweet valentine adieu think on thy proteus when thou haply seest some rare note worthy object in thy travel wish me partaker in thy happiness when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger if ever danger do environ thee commend thy grievance to my holy prayers for i will be thy beadsman valentine 

and on a love book pray for my success 

upon some book i love i'll pray for thee 

that's on some shallow story of deep love how young leander cross'd the hellespont 

that's a deep story of a deeper love for he was more than over shoes in love 

'tis true for you are over boots in love and yet you never swum the hellespont 

over the boots nay give me not the boots 

no i will not for it boots thee not 

what 

to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heart sore sighs one fading moment's mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights if haply won perhaps a hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labour won however but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquished 

so by your circumstance you call me fool 

so by your circumstance i fear you'll prove 

'tis love you cavil at i am not love 

love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yoked by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise 

yet writers say as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all 

and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow even so by love the young and tender wit is turn'd to folly blasting in the bud losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee that art a votary to fond desire once more adieu my father at the road expects my coming there to see me shipp'd 

and thither will i bring thee valentine 

sweet proteus no now let us take our leave to milan let me hear from thee by letters of thy success in love and what news else betideth here in absence of thy friend and likewise will visit thee with mine 

all happiness bechance to thee in milan 

as much to you at home and so farewell 

he after honour hunts i after love he leaves his friends to dignify them more i leave myself my friends and all for love thou julia thou hast metamorphosed me made me neglect my studies lose my time war with good counsel set the world at nought made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought enter speed

sir proteus save you saw you my master 

but now he parted hence to embark for milan 

twenty to one then he is shipp'd already and i have play'd the sheep in losing him 

indeed a sheep doth very often stray an if the shepherd be a while away 

you conclude that my master is a shepherd then and i a sheep 

i do 

why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep 

a silly answer and fitting well a sheep 

this proves me still a sheep 

true and thy master a shepherd 

nay that i can deny by a circumstance 

it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another 

the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore i am no sheep 

the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep 

such another proof will make me cry baa 

but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to julia 

ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labour 

here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons 

if the ground be overcharged you were best stick her 

nay in that you are astray twere best pound you 

nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter 

you mistake i mean the pound a pinfold 

from a pound to a pin fold it over and over tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover 

but what said she 

 first nodding ay 

nod ay why that's noddy 

you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and i say ay 

and that set together is noddy 

now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your pains 

no no you shall have it for bearing the letter 

well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you 

why sir how do you bear with me 

marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word noddy for my pains 

beshrew me but you have a quick wit 

and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse 

come come open the matter in brief what said she 

open your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered 

well sir here is for your pains what said she 

truly sir i think you'll hardly win her 

why couldst thou perceive so much from her 

sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind i fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind give her no token but stones for she's as hard as steel 

what said she nothing 

no not so much as take this for thy pains to testify your bounty i thank you you have testerned me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir i'll commend you to my master 

go go be gone to save your ship from wreck which cannot perish having thee aboard being destined to a drier death on shore exit speed i must go send some better messenger i fear my julia would not deign my lines receiving them from such a worthless post 

scene ii the same garden of julia's house 

enter julla and lucetta

but say lucetta now we are alone wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love 

ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully 

of all the fair resort of gentlemen that every day with parle encounter me in thy opinion which is worthiest love 

please you repeat their names i'll show my mind according to my shallow simple skill 

what think'st thou of the fair sir eglamour 

as of a knight well spoken neat and fine but were i you he never should be mine 

what think'st thou of the rich mercatio 

well of his wealth but of himself so so 

what think'st thou of the gentle proteus 

lord lord to see what folly reigns in us 

how now what means this passion at his name 

pardon dear madam tis a passing shame that i unworthy body as i am should censure thus on lovely gentlemen 

why not on proteus as of all the rest 

then thus of many good i think him best 

your reason 

i have no other but a woman's reason i think him so because i think him so 

and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him 

ay if you thought your love not cast away 

why he of all the rest hath never moved me 

yet he of all the rest i think best loves ye 

his little speaking shows his love but small 

fire that's closest kept burns most of all 

they do not love that do not show their love 

o they love least that let men know their love 

i would i knew his mind 

peruse this paper madam 

'to julia say from whom 

that the contents will show 

say say who gave it thee 

valentine's page and sent i think from proteus he would have given it you but i being in the way did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray 

now by my modesty a goodly broker dare you presume to harbour wanton lines to whisper and conspire against my youth now trust me tis an office of great worth and you an officer fit for the place or else return no more into my sight 

to plead for love deserves more fee than hate 

will ye be gone 

that you may ruminate 

and yet i would i had o'erlooked the letter it were a shame to call her back again and pray her to a fault for which i chid her what a fool is she that knows i am a maid and would not force the letter to my view since maids in modesty say no to that which they would have the profferer construe ay fie fie how wayward is this foolish love that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod how churlishly i chid lucetta hence when willingly i would have had her here how angerly i taught my brow to frown when inward joy enforced my heart to smile my penance is to call lucetta back and ask remission for my folly past what ho lucetta re enter lucetta

what would your ladyship 

is't near dinner time 

i would it were that you might kill your stomach on your meat and not upon your maid 

what is't that you took up so gingerly 

nothing 

why didst thou stoop then 

to take a paper up that i let fall 

and is that paper nothing 

nothing concerning me 

then let it lie for those that it concerns 

madam it will not lie where it concerns unless it have a false interpeter 

some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme 

that i might sing it madam to a tune give me a note your ladyship can set 

as little by such toys as may be possible best sing it to the tune of light o love 

it is too heavy for so light a tune 

heavy belike it hath some burden then 

ay and melodious were it would you sing it 

and why not you 

i cannot reach so high 

let's see your song how now minion 

keep tune there still so you will sing it out and yet methinks i do not like this tune 

you do not 

no madam it is too sharp 

you minion are too saucy 

nay now you are too flat and mar the concord with too harsh a descant there wanteth but a mean to fill your song 

the mean is drown'd with your unruly bass 

indeed i bid the base for proteus 

this babble shall not henceforth trouble me here is a coil with protestation tears the letter go get you gone and let the papers lie you would be fingering them to anger me 

she makes it strange but she would be best pleased to be so anger'd with another letter 

nay would i were so anger'd with the same o hateful hands to tear such loving words injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey and kill the bees that yield it with your stings i'll kiss each several paper for amends look here is writ kind julia unkind julia as in revenge of thy ingratitude i throw thy name against the bruising stones trampling contemptuously on thy disdain and here is writ love wounded proteus poor wounded name my bosom as a bed shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss but twice or thrice was proteus written down be calm good wind blow not a word away till i have found each letter in the letter except mine own name that some whirlwind bear unto a ragged fearful hanging rock and throw it thence into the raging sea lo here in one line is his name twice writ poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus to the sweet julia that i'll tear away and yet i will not sith so prettily he couples it to his complaining names thus will i fold them one on another now kiss embrace contend do what you will re enter lucetta

madam dinner is ready and your father stays 

well let us go 

what shall these papers lie like tell tales here 

if you respect them best to take them up 

nay i was taken up for laying them down yet here they shall not lie for catching cold 

i see you have a month's mind to them 

ay madam you may say what sights you see i see things too although you judge i wink 

come come will't please you go 

scene iii the same antonio's house 

enter antonio and panthino

tell me panthino what sad talk was that wherewith my brother held you in the cloister 

'twas of his nephew proteus your son 

why what of him 

he wonder'd that your lordship would suffer him to spend his youth at home while other men of slender reputation put forth their sons to seek preferment out some to the wars to try their fortune there some to discover islands far away some to the studious universities for any or for all these exercises he said that proteus your son was meet and did request me to importune you to let him spend his time no more at home which would be great impeachment to his age in having known no travel in his youth 

nor need'st thou much importune me to that whereon this month i have been hammering i have consider'd well his loss of time and how he cannot be a perfect man not being tried and tutor'd in the world experience is by industry achieved and perfected by the swift course of time then tell me whither were i best to send him 

i think your lordship is not ignorant how his companion youthful valentine attends the emperor in his royal court 

i know it well 

'twere good i think your lordship sent him thither there shall he practise tilts and tournaments hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen and be in eye of every exercise worthy his youth and nobleness of birth 

i like thy counsel well hast thou advised and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it the execution of it shall make known even with the speediest expedition i will dispatch him to the emperor's court 

to morrow may it please you don alphonso with other gentlemen of good esteem are journeying to salute the emperor and to commend their service to his will 

good company with them shall proteus go and in good time now will we break with him enter proteus

sweet love sweet lines sweet life here is her hand the agent of her heart here is her oath for love her honour's pawn o that our fathers would applaud our loves to seal our happiness with their consents o heavenly julia 

how now what letter are you reading there 

may't please your lordship tis a word or two of commendations sent from valentine deliver'd by a friend that came from him 

lend me the letter let me see what news 

there is no news my lord but that he writes how happily he lives how well beloved and daily graced by the emperor wishing me with him partner of his fortune 

and how stand you affected to his wish 

as one relying on your lordship's will and not depending on his friendly wish 

my will is something sorted with his wish muse not that i thus suddenly proceed for what i will i will and there an end i am resolved that thou shalt spend some time with valentinus in the emperor's court what maintenance he from his friends receives like exhibition thou shalt have from me to morrow be in readiness to go excuse it not for i am peremptory 

my lord i cannot be so soon provided please you deliberate a day or two 

look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee no more of stay to morrow thou must go come on panthino you shall be employ'd to hasten on his expedition exeunt antonio and panthino

thus have i shunn'd the fire for fear of burning and drench'd me in the sea where i am drown'd i fear'd to show my father julia's letter lest he should take exceptions to my love and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love o how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by and by a cloud takes all away re enter panthino

sir proteus your father calls for you he is in haste therefore i pray you to go 

why this it is my heart accords thereto and yet a thousand times it answers no 

scene i milan the duke's palace 

enter valentine and speed

sir your glove 

not mine my gloves are on 

why then this may be yours for this is but one 

ha let me see ay give it me it's mine sweet ornament that decks a thing divine ah silvia silvia 

madam silvia madam silvia 

how now sirrah 

she is not within hearing sir 

why sir who bade you call her 

your worship sir or else i mistook 

well you'll still be too forward 

and yet i was last chidden for being too slow 

go to sir tell me do you know madam silvia 

she that your worship loves 

why how know you that i am in love 

marry by these special marks first you have learned like sir proteus to wreathe your arms like a malecontent to relish a love song like a robin redbreast to walk alone like one that had the pestilence to sigh like a school boy that had lost his a b c to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears robbing to speak puling like a beggar at hallowmas you were wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walked to walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner when you looked sadly it was for want of money and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress that when i look on you i can hardly think you my master 

are all these things perceived in me 

they are all perceived without ye 

without me they cannot 

without you nay that's certain for without you were so simple none else would but you are so without these follies that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady 

but tell me dost thou know my lady silvia 

she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper 

hast thou observed that even she i mean 

why sir i know her not 

dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet knowest her not 

is she not hard favoured sir 

not so fair boy as well favoured 

sir i know that well enough 

what dost thou know 

that she is not so fair as of you well favoured 

i mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite 

that's because the one is painted and the other out of all count 

how painted and how out of count 

marry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts of her beauty 

how esteemest thou me i account of her beauty 

you never saw her since she was deformed 

how long hath she been deformed 

ever since you loved her 

i have loved her ever since i saw her and still i see her beautiful 

if you love her you cannot see her 

why 

because love is blind o that you had mine eyes or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at sir proteus for going ungartered 

what should i see then 

your own present folly and her passing deformity for he being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose 

belike boy then you are in love for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes 

true sir i was in love with my bed i thank you you swinged me for my love which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours 

in conclusion i stand affected to her 

i would you were set so your affection would cease 

last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves 

and have you 

i have 

are they not lamely writ 

no boy but as well as i can do them peace here she comes 

 aside o excellent motion o exceeding puppet now will he interpret to her enter silvia

madam and mistress a thousand good morrows 

 aside o give ye good even here's a million of manners 

sir valentine and servant to you two thousand 

 aside he should give her interest and she gives it him 

as you enjoin'd me i have writ your letter unto the secret nameless friend of yours which i was much unwilling to proceed in but for my duty to your ladyship 

i thank you gentle servant tis very clerkly done 

now trust me madam it came hardly off for being ignorant to whom it goes i writ at random very doubtfully 

perchance you think too much of so much pains 

no madam so it stead you i will write please you command a thousand times as much and yet 

a pretty period well i guess the sequel and yet i will not name it and yet i care not and yet take this again and yet i thank you meaning henceforth to trouble you no more 

 aside and yet you will and yet another yet 

what means your ladyship do you not like it 

yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ but since unwillingly take them again nay take them 

madam they are for you 

ay ay you writ them sir at my request but i will none of them they are for you i would have had them writ more movingly 

please you i'll write your ladyship another 

and when it's writ for my sake read it over and if it please you so if not why so 

if it please me madam what then 

why if it please you take it for your labour and so good morrow servant 

o jest unseen inscrutable invisible as a nose on a man's face or a weathercock on a steeple my master sues to her and she hath taught her suitor he being her pupil to become her tutor o excellent device was there ever heard a better that my master being scribe to himself should write the letter 

how now sir what are you reasoning with yourself 

nay i was rhyming tis you that have the reason 

to do what 

to be a spokesman for madam silvia 

to whom 

to yourself why she wooes you by a figure 

what figure 

by a letter i should say 

why she hath not writ to me 

what need she when she hath made you write to yourself why do you not perceive the jest 

no believe me 

no believing you indeed sir but did you perceive her earnest 

she gave me none except an angry word 

why she hath given you a letter 

that's the letter i writ to her friend 

and that letter hath she delivered and there an end 

i would it were no worse 

i'll warrant you tis as well for often have you writ to her and she in modesty or else for want of idle time could not again reply or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover all this i speak in print for in print i found it why muse you sir tis dinner time 

i have dined 

ay but hearken sir though the chameleon love can feed on the air i am one that am nourished by my victuals and would fain have meat o be not like your mistress be moved be moved 

scene ii verona julia's house 

enter proteus and julia

when possibly i can i will return 

if you turn not you will return the sooner keep this remembrance for thy julia's sake giving a ring

my jerkin is a doublet 

well then i'll double your folly 

how 

what angry sir thurio do you change colour 

give him leave madam he is a kind of chameleon 

that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air 

you have said sir 

ay sir and done too for this time 

i know it well sir you always end ere you begin 

a fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off 

'tis indeed madam we thank the giver 

who is that servant 

yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire sir thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your company 

sir if you spend word for word with me i shall make your wit bankrupt 

i know it well sir you have an exchequer of words and i think no other treasure to give your followers for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words 

no more gentlemen no more here comes my father enter duke

now daughter silvia you are hard beset sir valentine your father's in good health what say you to a letter from your friends of much good news 

my lord i will be thankful to any happy messenger from thence 

know ye don antonio your countryman 

ay my good lord i know the gentleman to be of worth and worthy estimation and not without desert so well reputed 

hath he not a son 

ay my good lord a son that well deserves the honour and regard of such a father 

you know him well 

i know him as myself for from our infancy we have conversed and spent our hours together and though myself have been an idle truant omitting the sweet benefit of time to clothe mine age with angel like perfection yet hath sir proteus for that's his name made use and fair advantage of his days his years but young but his experience old his head unmellow'd but his judgment ripe and in a word for far behind his worth comes all the praises that i now bestow he is complete in feature and in mind with all good grace to grace a gentleman 

beshrew me sir but if he make this good he is as worthy for an empress love as meet to be an emperor's counsellor well sir this gentleman is come to me with commendation from great potentates and here he means to spend his time awhile i think tis no unwelcome news to you 

should i have wish'd a thing it had been he 

welcome him then according to his worth silvia i speak to you and you sir thurio for valentine i need not cite him to it i will send him hither to you presently 

this is the gentleman i told your ladyship had come along with me but that his mistress did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks 

belike that now she hath enfranchised them upon some other pawn for fealty 

nay sure i think she holds them prisoners still 

nay then he should be blind and being blind how could he see his way to seek out you 

why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes 

they say that love hath not an eye at all 

to see such lovers thurio as yourself upon a homely object love can wink 

have done have done here comes the gentleman exit thurio enter proteus

welcome dear proteus mistress i beseech you confirm his welcome with some special favour 

his worth is warrant for his welcome hither if this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from 

mistress it is sweet lady entertain him to be my fellow servant to your ladyship 

too low a mistress for so high a servant 

not so sweet lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress 

leave off discourse of disability sweet lady entertain him for your servant 

my duty will i boast of nothing else 

and duty never yet did want his meed servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress 

i'll die on him that says so but yourself 

that you are welcome 

that you are worthless re enter thurio

madam my lord your father would speak with you 

i wait upon his pleasure come sir thurio go with me once more new servant welcome i'll leave you to confer of home affairs when you have done we look to hear from you 

we'll both attend upon your ladyship exeunt silvia and thurio

now tell me how do all from whence you came 

your friends are well and have them much commended 

and how do yours 

i left them all in health 

how does your lady and how thrives your love 

my tales of love were wont to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse 

ay proteus but that life is alter'd now i have done penance for contemning love whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me with bitter fasts with penitential groans with nightly tears and daily heart sore sighs for in revenge of my contempt of love love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes and made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow o gentle proteus love's a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love 

enough i read your fortune in your eye was this the idol that you worship so 

even she and is she not a heavenly saint 

no but she is an earthly paragon 

call her divine 

i will not flatter her 

o flatter me for love delights in praises 

when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you 

then speak the truth by her if not divine yet let her be a principality sovereign to all the creatures on the earth 

except my mistress 

sweet except not any except thou wilt except against my love 

have i not reason to prefer mine own 

and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honour to bear my lady's train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favour growing proud disdain to root the summer swelling flower and make rough winter everlastingly 

why valentine what braggardism is this 

pardon me proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing she is alone 

then let her alone 

not for the world why man she is mine own and i as rich in having such a jewel as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl the water nectar and the rocks pure gold forgive me that i do not dream on thee because thou see'st me dote upon my love my foolish rival that her father likes only for his possessions are so huge is gone with her along and i must after for love thou know'st is full of jealousy 

but she loves you 

ay and we are betroth'd nay more our marriage hour with all the cunning manner of our flight determined of how i must climb her window the ladder made of cords and all the means plotted and greed on for my happiness good proteus go with me to my chamber in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel 

go on before i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then i'll presently attend you 

will you make haste 

i will exit valentine even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten is it mine or valentine's praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love that i did love for now my love is thaw'd which like a waxen image gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont o but i love his lady too too much and that's the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reason's light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind if i can cheque my erring love i will if not to compass her i'll use my skill 

scene v the same a street 

enter speed and launce severally

launce by mine honesty welcome to milan 

forswear not thyself sweet youth for i am not welcome i reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say welcome 

come on you madcap i'll to the alehouse with you presently where for one shot of five pence thou shalt have five thousand welcomes but sirrah how did thy master part with madam julia 

marry after they closed in earnest they parted very fairly in jest 

but shall she marry him 

no 

how then shall he marry her 

no neither 

what are they broken 

no they are both as whole as a fish 

why then how stands the matter with them 

marry thus when it stands well with him it stands well with her 

what an ass art thou i understand thee not 

what a block art thou that thou canst not my staff understands me 

what thou sayest 

ay and what i do too look thee i'll but lean and my staff understands me 

it stands under thee indeed 

why stand under and under stand is all one 

but tell me true will't be a match 

ask my dog if he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will 

the conclusion is then that it will 

thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable 

'tis well that i get it so but launce how sayest thou that my master is become a notable lover 

i never knew him otherwise 

than how 

a notable lubber as thou reportest him to be 

why thou whoreson ass thou mistakest me 

why fool i meant not thee i meant thy master 

i tell thee my master is become a hot lover 

why i tell thee i care not though he burn himself in love if thou wilt go with me to the alehouse if not thou art an hebrew a jew and not worth the name of a christian 

why 

because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a christian wilt thou go 

at thy service

to leave my julia shall i be forsworn to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn and even that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear o sweet suggesting love if thou hast sinned teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolved will to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd with twenty thousand soul confirming oaths i cannot leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia silvia i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and silvia witness heaven that made her fair shows julia but a swarthy ethiope i will forget that julia is alive remembering that my love to her is dead and valentine i'll hold an enemy aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend i cannot now prove constant to myself without some treachery used to valentine this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial silvia's chamber window myself in counsel his competitor now presently i'll give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enraged will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter but valentine being gone i'll quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurio's dull proceeding love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift 

scene vii verona julia's house 

enter julia and lucetta

counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me and even in kind love i do conjure thee who art the table wherein all my thoughts are visibly character'd and engraved to lesson me and tell me some good mean how with my honour i may undertake a journey to my loving proteus 

alas the way is wearisome and long 

a true devoted pilgrim is not weary to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps much less shall she that hath love's wings to fly and when the flight is made to one so dear of such divine perfection as sir proteus 

better forbear till proteus make return 

o know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food pity the dearth that i have pined in by longing for that food so long a time didst thou but know the inly touch of love thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words 

i do not seek to quench your love's hot fire but qualify the fire's extreme rage lest it should burn above the bounds of reason 

the more thou damm'st it up the more it burns the current that with gentle murmur glides thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage but when his fair course is not hindered he makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage and so by many winding nooks he strays with willing sport to the wild ocean then let me go and hinder not my course i'll be as patient as a gentle stream and make a pastime of each weary step till the last step have brought me to my love and there i'll rest as after much turmoil a blessed soul doth in elysium 

but in what habit will you go along 

not like a woman for i would prevent the loose encounters of lascivious men gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds as may beseem some well reputed page 

why then your ladyship must cut your hair 

no girl i'll knit it up in silken strings with twenty odd conceited true love knots to be fantastic may become a youth of greater time than i shall show to be 

what fashion madam shall i make your breeches 

that fits as well as tell me good my lord what compass will you wear your farthingale why even what fashion thou best likest lucetta 

you must needs have them with a codpiece madam 

out out lucetta that would be ill favour'd 

a round hose madam now's not worth a pin unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on 

lucetta as thou lovest me let me have what thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly but tell me wench how will the world repute me for undertaking so unstaid a journey i fear me it will make me scandalized 

if you think so then stay at home and go not 

nay that i will not 

then never dream on infamy but go if proteus like your journey when you come no matter who's displeased when you are gone i fear me he will scarce be pleased withal 

that is the least lucetta of my fear a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears and instances of infinite of love warrant me welcome to my proteus 

all these are servants to deceitful men 

base men that use them to so base effect but truer stars did govern proteus birth his words are bonds his oaths are oracles his love sincere his thoughts immaculate his tears pure messengers sent from his heart his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth 

pray heaven he prove so when you come to him 

now as thou lovest me do him not that wrong to bear a hard opinion of his truth only deserve my love by loving him and presently go with me to my chamber to take a note of what i stand in need of to furnish me upon my longing journey all that is mine i leave at thy dispose my goods my lands my reputation only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence come answer not but to it presently i am impatient of my tarriance 

scene i milan the duke's palace 

enter duke thurio and proteus

sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile we have some secrets to confer about exit thurio now tell me proteus what's your will with me 

my gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favours done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stol'n away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my duty's sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave 

proteus i thank thee for thine honest care which to requite command me while i live this love of theirs myself have often seen haply when they have judged me fast asleep and oftentimes have purposed to forbid sir valentine her company and my court but fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man a rashness that i ever yet have shunn'd i gave him gentle looks thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclosed to me and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this knowing that tender youth is soon suggested i nightly lodge her in an upper tower the key whereof myself have ever kept and thence she cannot be convey'd away 

know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamber window will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aimed at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretence 

upon mine honour he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this 

adieu my lord sir valentine is coming enter valentine

sir valentine whither away so fast 

please it your grace there is a messenger that stays to bear my letters to my friends and i am going to deliver them 

be they of much import 

the tenor of them doth but signify my health and happy being at your court 

nay then no matter stay with me awhile i am to break with thee of some affairs that touch me near wherein thou must be secret tis not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter 

i know it well my lord and sure the match were rich and honourable besides the gentleman is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter cannot your grace win her to fancy him 

no trust me she is peevish sullen froward proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father and may i say to thee this pride of hers upon advice hath drawn my love from her and where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherish'd by her child like duty i now am full resolved to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in then let her beauty be her wedding dower for me and my possessions she esteems not 

what would your grace have me to do in this 

there is a lady in verona here whom i affect but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my aged eloquence now therefore would i have thee to my tutor for long agone i have forgot to court besides the fashion of the time is changed how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her sun bright eye 

win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a woman's mind 

but she did scorn a present that i sent her 

a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her send her another never give her o'er for scorn at first makes after love the more if she do frown tis not in hate of you but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide tis not to have you gone for why the fools are mad if left alone take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their graces though ne'er so black say they have angels faces that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman 

but she i mean is promised by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth and kept severely from resort of men that no man hath access by day to her 

why then i would resort to her by night 

ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe that no man hath recourse to her by night 

what lets but one may enter at her window 

her chamber is aloft far from the ground and built so shelving that one cannot climb it without apparent hazard of his life 

why then a ladder quaintly made of cords to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks would serve to scale another hero's tower so bold leander would adventure it 

now as thou art a gentleman of blood advise me where i may have such a ladder 

when would you use it pray sir tell me that 

this very night for love is like a child that longs for every thing that he can come by 

by seven o'clock i'll get you such a ladder 

but hark thee i will go to her alone how shall i best convey the ladder thither 

it will be light my lord that you may bear it under a cloak that is of any length 

a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn 

ay my good lord 

then let me see thy cloak i'll get me one of such another length 

why any cloak will serve the turn my lord 

how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me what letter is this same what's here to silvia and here an engine fit for my proceeding i'll be so bold to break the seal for once reads my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly and slaves they are to me that send them flying o could their master come and go as lightly himself would lodge where senseless they are lying my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them while i their king that hither them importune do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them because myself do want my servants fortune i curse myself for they are sent by me that they should harbour where their lord would be what's here silvia this night i will enfranchise thee tis so and here's the ladder for the purpose why phaeton for thou art merops son wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car and with thy daring folly burn the world wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee go base intruder overweening slave bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates and think my patience more than thy desert is privilege for thy departure hence thank me for this more than for all the favours which all too much i have bestow'd on thee but if thou linger in my territories longer than swiftest expedition will give thee time to leave our royal court by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love i ever bore my daughter or thyself be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse but as thou lovest thy life make speed from hence 

and why not death rather than living torment to die is to be banish'd from myself and silvia is myself banish'd from her is self from self a deadly banishment what light is light if silvia be not seen what joy is joy if silvia be not by unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection except i be by silvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale unless i look on silvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon she is my essence and i leave to be if i be not by her fair influence foster'd illumined cherish'd kept alive i fly not death to fly his deadly doom tarry i here i but attend on death but fly i hence i fly away from life enter proteus and launce

no valentine 

no valentine if silvia have forsworn me what is your news 

sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished 

that thou art banished o that's the news from hence from silvia and from me thy friend 

o i have fed upon this woe already and now excess of it will make me surfeit doth silvia know that i am banished 

ay ay and she hath offer'd to the doom which unreversed stands in effectual force a sea of melting pearl which some call tears those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd with them upon her knees her humble self wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them as if but now they waxed pale for woe but neither bended knees pure hands held up sad sighs deep groans nor silver shedding tears could penetrate her uncompassionate sire but valentine if he be ta'en must die besides her intercession chafed him so when she for thy repeal was suppliant that to close prison he commanded her with many bitter threats of biding there 

no more unless the next word that thou speak'st have some malignant power upon my life if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear as ending anthem of my endless dolour 

cease to lament for that thou canst not help and study help for that which thou lament'st time is the nurse and breeder of all good here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love besides thy staying will abridge thy life hope is a lover's staff walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts thy letters may be here though thou art hence which being writ to me shall be deliver'd even in the milk white bosom of thy love the time now serves not to expostulate come i'll convey thee through the city gate and ere i part with thee confer at large of all that may concern thy love affairs as thou lovest silvia though not for thyself regard thy danger and along with me 

i pray thee launce an if thou seest my boy bid him make haste and meet me at the north gate 

go sirrah find him out come valentine 

o my dear silvia hapless valentine exeunt valentine and proteus

i am but a fool look you and yet i have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave but that's all one if he be but one knave he lives not now that knows me to be in love yet i am in love but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who tis i love and yet tis a woman but what woman i will not tell myself and yet tis a milkmaid yet tis not a maid for she hath had gossips yet tis a maid for she is her master's maid and serves for wages she hath more qualities than a water spaniel which is much in a bare christian pulling out a paper here is the cate log of her condition imprimis she can fetch and carry why a horse can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a jade item she can milk look you a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands enter speed

how now signior launce what news with your mastership 

with my master's ship why it is at sea 

well your old vice still mistake the word what news then in your paper

why man how black 

why as black as ink 

let me read them 

fie on thee jolt head thou canst not read 

thou liest i can 

i will try thee tell me this who begot thee 

marry the son of my grandfather 

o illiterate loiterer it was the son of thy grandmother this proves that thou canst not read 

come fool come try me in thy paper 

there and st nicholas be thy speed 

 reads imprimis she can milk 

ay that she can 

'item she brews good ale 

and thereof comes the proverb blessing of your heart you brew good ale 

'item she can sew 

that's as much as to say can she so 

'item she can knit 

what need a man care for a stock with a wench when she can knit him a stock 

'item she can wash and scour 

a special virtue for then she need not be washed and scoured 

'item she can spin 

then may i set the world on wheels when she can spin for her living 

'item she hath many nameless virtues 

that's as much as to say bastard virtues that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names 

'here follow her vices 

close at the heels of her virtues 

'item she is not to be kissed fasting in respect of her breath 

well that fault may be mended with a breakfast read on 

'item she hath a sweet mouth 

that makes amends for her sour breath 

'item she doth talk in her sleep 

it's no matter for that so she sleep not in her talk 

'item she is slow in words 

o villain that set this down among her vices to be slow in words is a woman's only virtue i pray thee out with't and place it for her chief virtue 

'item she is proud 

out with that too it was eve's legacy and cannot be ta'en from her 

'item she hath no teeth 

i care not for that neither because i love crusts 

'item she is curst 

well the best is she hath no teeth to bite 

'item she will often praise her liquor 

if her liquor be good she shall if she will not i will for good things should be praised 

'item she is too liberal 

of her tongue she cannot for that's writ down she is slow of of her purse she shall not for that i'll keep shut now of another thing she may and that cannot i help well proceed 

'item she hath more hair than wit and more faults than hairs and more wealth than faults 

stop there i'll have her she was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article rehearse that once more 

'item she hath more hair than wit 

more hair than wit it may be i'll prove it the cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it is more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit for the greater hides the less what's next 

'and more faults than hairs 

that's monstrous o that that were out 

'and more wealth than faults 

why that word makes the faults gracious well i'll have her and if it be a match as nothing is impossible 

what then 

why then will i tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the north gate 

for me 

for thee ay who art thou he hath stayed for a better man than thee 

and must i go to him 

thou must run to him for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn 

why didst not tell me sooner pox of your love letters 

now will he be swinged for reading my letter an unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into secrets i'll after to rejoice in the boy's correction 

scene ii the same the duke's palace 

enter duke and thurio

sir thurio fear not but that she will love you now valentine is banish'd from her sight 

since his exile she hath despised me most forsworn my company and rail'd at me that i am desperate of obtaining her 

this weak impress of love is as a figure trenched in ice which with an hour's heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot enter proteus how now sir proteus is your countryman according to our proclamation gone 

gone my good lord 

my daughter takes his going grievously 

a little time my lord will kill that grief 

so i believe but thurio thinks not so proteus the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee 

longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace 

thou know'st how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter 

i do my lord 

and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will

she did my lord when valentine was here 

ay and perversely she persevers so what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio 

the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate 

ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate 

ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend 

then you must undertake to slander him 

and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend 

where your good word cannot advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend 

you have prevail'd my lord if i can do it by ought that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio 

therefore as you unwind her love from him lest it should ravel and be good to none you must provide to bottom it on me which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine 

and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentine's report you are already love's firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friend's sake will be glad of you where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend 

as much as i can do i will effect but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes should be full fraught with serviceable vows 

ay much is the force of heaven bred poesy 

say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews whose golden touch could soften steel and stones make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands after your dire lamenting elegies visit by night your lady's chamber window with some sweet concert to their instruments tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence will well become such sweet complaining grievance this or else nothing will inherit her 

this discipline shows thou hast been in love 

and thy advice this night i'll put in practise therefore sweet proteus my direction giver let us into the city presently to sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music i have a sonnet that will serve the turn to give the onset to thy good advice 

about it gentlemen 

we'll wait upon your grace till after supper and afterward determine our proceedings 

even now about it i will pardon you

it seems you loved not her to leave her token she is dead belike 

not so i think she lives 

alas 

why dost thou cry alas 

i cannot choose but pity her 

wherefore shouldst thou pity her 

because methinks that she loved you as well as you do love your lady silvia she dreams of him that has forgot her love you dote on her that cares not for your love tis pity love should be so contrary and thinking of it makes me cry alas 

well give her that ring and therewithal this letter that's her chamber tell my lady i claim the promise for her heavenly picture your message done hie home unto my chamber where thou shalt find me sad and solitary 

how many women would do such a message alas poor proteus thou hast entertain'd a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs alas poor fool why do i pity him that with his very heart despiseth me because he loves her he despiseth me because i love him i must pity him this ring i gave him when he parted from me to bind him to remember my good will and now am i unhappy messenger to plead for that which i would not obtain to carry that which i would have refused to praise his faith which i would have dispraised i am my master's true confirmed love but cannot be true servant to my master unless i prove false traitor to myself yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly as heaven it knows i would not have him speed enter silvia attended gentlewoman good day i pray you be my mean to bring me where to speak with madam silvia 

what would you with her if that i be she 

if you be she i do entreat your patience to hear me speak the message i am sent on 

from whom 

from my master sir proteus madam 

o he sends you for a picture 

ay madam 

ursula bring my picture here go give your master this tell him from me one julia that his changing thoughts forget would better fit his chamber than this shadow 

madam please you peruse this letter pardon me madam i have unadvised deliver'd you a paper that i should not this is the letter to your ladyship 

i pray thee let me look on that again 

it may not be good madam pardon me 

there hold i will not look upon your master's lines i know they are stuff'd with protestations and full of new found oaths which he will break as easily as i do tear his paper 

madam he sends your ladyship this ring 

the more shame for him that he sends it me for i have heard him say a thousand times his julia gave it him at his departure though his false finger have profaned the ring mine shall not do his julia so much wrong 

she thanks you 

what say'st thou 

i thank you madam that you tender her poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much 

dost thou know her 

almost as well as i do know myself to think upon her woes i do protest that i have wept a hundred several times 

belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her 

i think she doth and that's her cause of sorrow 

is she not passing fair 

she hath been fairer madam than she is when she did think my master loved her well she in my judgment was as fair as you but since she did neglect her looking glass and threw her sun expelling mask away the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks and pinch'd the lily tincture of her face that now she is become as black as i 

how tall was she 

about my stature for at pentecost when all our pageants of delight were play'd our youth got me to play the woman's part and i was trimm'd in madam julia's gown which served me as fit by all men's judgments as if the garment had been made for me therefore i know she is about my height and at that time i made her weep agood for i did play a lamentable part madam twas ariadne passioning for theseus perjury and unjust flight which i so lively acted with my tears that my poor mistress moved therewithal wept bitterly and would i might be dead if i in thought felt not her very sorrow 

she is beholding to thee gentle youth alas poor lady desolate and left i weep myself to think upon thy words here youth there is my purse i give thee this for thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovest her farewell exit silvia with attendants

and she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful i hope my master's suit will be but cold since she respects my mistress love so much alas how love can trifle with itself here is her picture let me see i think if i had such a tire this face of mine were full as lovely as is this of hers and yet the painter flatter'd her a little unless i flatter with myself too much her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow if that be all the difference in his love i'll get me such a colour'd periwig her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine ay but her forehead's low and mine's as high what should it be that he respects in her but i can make respective in myself if this fond love were not a blinded god come shadow come and take this shadow up for tis thy rival o thou senseless form thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd loved and adored and were there sense in his idolatry my substance should be statue in thy stead i'll use thee kindly for thy mistress sake that used me so or else by jove i vow i should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes to make my master out of love with thee 

scene i milan an abbey 

enter eglamour

the sun begins to gild the western sky and now it is about the very hour that silvia at friar patrick's cell should meet me she will not fail for lovers break not hours unless it be to come before their time so much they spur their expedition see where she comes enter silvia lady a happy evening 

amen amen go on good eglamour out at the postern by the abbey wall i fear i am attended by some spies 

fear not the forest is not three leagues off if we recover that we are sure enough 

scene ii the same the duke's palace 

enter thurio proteus and julia

sir proteus what says silvia to my suit 

o sir i find her milder than she was and yet she takes exceptions at your person 

what that my leg is too long 

no that it is too little 

i'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder 

 aside but love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes 

what says she to my face 

she says it is a fair one 

nay then the wanton lies my face is black 

but pearls are fair and the old saying is black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes 

 aside tis true such pearls as put out ladies eyes for i had rather wink than look on them 

how likes she my discourse 

ill when you talk of war 

but well when i discourse of love and peace 

 aside but better indeed when you hold your peace 

what says she to my valour 

o sir she makes no doubt of that 

 aside she needs not when she knows it cowardice 

what says she to my birth 

that you are well derived 

 aside true from a gentleman to a fool 

considers she my possessions 

o ay and pities them 

wherefore 

 aside that such an ass should owe them 

that they are out by lease 

here comes the duke enter duke

how now sir proteus how now thurio which of you saw sir eglamour of late 

not i 

nor i 

saw you my daughter 

neither 

why then she's fled unto that peasant valentine and eglamour is in her company tis true for friar laurence met them both as he in penance wander'd through the forest him he knew well and guess'd that it was she but being mask'd he was not sure of it besides she did intend confession at patrick's cell this even and there she was not these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence therefore i pray you stand not to discourse but mount you presently and meet with me upon the rising of the mountain foot that leads towards mantua whither they are fled dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me 

why this it is to be a peevish girl that flies her fortune when it follows her i'll after more to be revenged on eglamour than for the love of reckless silvia 

and i will follow more for silvia's love than hate of eglamour that goes with her 

and i will follow more to cross that love than hate for silvia that is gone for love 

scene iii the frontiers of mantua the forest 

enter outlaws with silvia

first outlaw

come come be patient we must bring you to our captain 

a thousand more mischances than this one have learn'd me how to brook this patiently 

second outlaw

come bring her away 

first outlaw

where is the gentleman that was with her 

third outlaw

being nimble footed he hath outrun us but moyses and valerius follow him go thou with her to the west end of the wood there is our captain we'll follow him that's fled the thicket is beset he cannot scape 

first outlaw

come i must bring you to our captain's cave fear not he bears an honourable mind and will not use a woman lawlessly 

o valentine this i endure for thee 

scene iv another part of the forest 

enter valentine

how use doth breed a habit in a man this shadowy desert unfrequented woods i better brook than flourishing peopled towns here can i sit alone unseen of any and to the nightingale's complaining notes tune my distresses and record my woes o thou that dost inhabit in my breast leave not the mansion so long tenantless lest growing ruinous the building fall and leave no memory of what it was repair me with thy presence silvia thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain what halloing and what stir is this to day these are my mates that make their wills their law have some unhappy passenger in chase they love me well yet i have much to do to keep them from uncivil outrages withdraw thee valentine who's this comes here enter proteus silvia and julia

madam this service i have done for you though you respect not aught your servant doth to hazard life and rescue you from him that would have forced your honour and your love vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look a smaller boon than this i cannot beg and less than this i am sure you cannot give 

 aside how like a dream is this i see and hear love lend me patience to forbear awhile 

o miserable unhappy that i am 

unhappy were you madam ere i came but by my coming i have made you happy 

by thy approach thou makest me most unhappy 

 aside and me when he approacheth to your presence 

had i been seized by a hungry lion i would have been a breakfast to the beast rather than have false proteus rescue me o heaven be judge how i love valentine whose life's as tender to me as my soul and full as much for more there cannot be i do detest false perjured proteus therefore be gone solicit me no more 

what dangerous action stood it next to death would i not undergo for one calm look o tis the curse in love and still approved when women cannot love where they're beloved 

when proteus cannot love where he's beloved read over julia's heart thy first best love for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith into a thousand oaths and all those oaths descended into perjury to love me thou hast no faith left now unless thou'dst two and that's far worse than none better have none than plural faith which is too much by one thou counterfeit to thy true friend 

in love who respects friend 

all men but proteus 

nay if the gentle spirit of moving words can no way change you to a milder form i'll woo you like a soldier at arms end and love you gainst the nature of love force ye 

o heaven 

i'll force thee yield to my desire 

ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch thou friend of an ill fashion 

valentine 

thou common friend that's without faith or love for such is a friend now treacherous man thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye could have persuaded me now i dare not say i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me who should be trusted when one's own right hand is perjured to the bosom proteus i am sorry i must never trust thee more but count the world a stranger for thy sake the private wound is deepest o time most accurst mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst 

my shame and guilt confounds me forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence i tender t here i do as truly suffer as e'er i did commit 

then i am paid and once again i do receive thee honest who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased by penitence the eternal's wrath's appeased and that my love may appear plain and free all that was mine in silvia i give thee 

o me unhappy swoons

look to the boy 

why boy why wag how now what's the matter look up speak 

o good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring to madam silvia which out of my neglect was never done 

where is that ring boy 

here tis this is it 

how let me see why this is the ring i gave to julia 

o cry you mercy sir i have mistook this is the ring you sent to silvia 

but how camest thou by this ring at my depart i gave this unto julia 

and julia herself did give it me and julia herself hath brought it hither 

how julia 

behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths and entertain'd em deeply in her heart how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root o proteus let this habit make thee blush be thou ashamed that i have took upon me such an immodest raiment if shame live in a disguise of love it is the lesser blot modesty finds women to change their shapes than men their minds 

than men their minds tis true o heaven were man but constant he were perfect that one error fills him with faults makes him run through all the sins inconstancy falls off ere it begins what is in silvia's face but i may spy more fresh in julia's with a constant eye 

come come a hand from either let me be blest to make this happy close twere pity two such friends should be long foes 

bear witness heaven i have my wish for ever 

and i mine enter outlaws with duke and thurio

sir valentine 

yonder is silvia and silvia's mine 

thurio give back or else embrace thy death come not within the measure of my wrath do not name silvia thine if once again verona shall not hold thee here she stands take but possession of her with a touch i dare thee but to breathe upon my love 

sir valentine i care not for her i i hold him but a fool that will endanger his body for a girl that loves him not i claim her not and therefore she is thine 

the more degenerate and base art thou to make such means for her as thou hast done and leave her on such slight conditions now by the honour of my ancestry i do applaud thy spirit valentine and think thee worthy of an empress love know then i here forget all former griefs cancel all grudge repeal thee home again plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit to which i thus subscribe sir valentine thou art a gentleman and well derived take thou thy silvia for thou hast deserved her 

i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy i now beseech you for your daughter's sake to grant one boom that i shall ask of you 

i grant it for thine own whate'er it be 

these banish'd men that i have kept withal are men endued with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recall'd from their exile they are reformed civil full of good and fit for great employment worthy lord 

thou hast prevail'd i pardon them and thee dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts come let us go we will include all jars with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity 

and as we walk along i dare be bold with our discourse to make your grace to smile what think you of this page my lord 

i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes 

i warrant you my lord more grace than boy 

what mean you by that saying 

please you i'll tell you as we pass along that you will wonder what hath fortuned come proteus tis your penance but to hear the story of your loves discovered that done our day of marriage shall be yours one feast one house one mutual happiness
