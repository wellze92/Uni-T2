now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze any thing the wills above be done but i would fain die a dry death 

scene ii the island before prospero's cell 

enter prospero and miranda

if by your art my dearest father you have put the wild waters in this roar allay them the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch but that the sea mounting to the welkin's cheek dashes the fire out o i have suffered with those that i saw suffer a brave vessel who had no doubt some noble creature in her dash'd all to pieces o the cry did knock against my very heart poor souls they perish'd had i been any god of power i would have sunk the sea within the earth or ere it should the good ship so have swallow'd and the fraughting souls within her 

be collected no more amazement tell your piteous heart there's no harm done 

o woe the day 

no harm i have done nothing but in care of thee of thee my dear one thee my daughter who art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing of whence i am nor that i am more better than prospero master of a full poor cell and thy no greater father 

more to know did never meddle with my thoughts 

'tis time i should inform thee farther lend thy hand and pluck my magic garment from me so lays down his mantle lie there my art wipe thou thine eyes have comfort the direful spectacle of the wreck which touch'd the very virtue of compassion in thee i have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul no not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature in the vessel which thou heard'st cry which thou saw'st sink sit down for thou must now know farther 

you have often begun to tell me what i am but stopp'd and left me to a bootless inquisition concluding stay not yet 

the hour's now come the very minute bids thee ope thine ear obey and be attentive canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not out three years old 

certainly sir i can 

by what by any other house or person of any thing the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance 

'tis far off and rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants had i not four or five women once that tended me 

thou hadst and more miranda but how is it that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time if thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here how thou camest here thou mayst 

but that i do not 

twelve year since miranda twelve year since thy father was the duke of milan and a prince of power 

sir are not you my father 

thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter and thy father was duke of milan and thou his only heir and princess no worse issued 

o the heavens what foul play had we that we came from thence or blessed was't we did 

both both my girl by foul play as thou say'st were we heaved thence but blessedly holp hither 

o my heart bleeds to think o the teen that i have turn'd you to which is from my remembrance please you farther 

my brother and thy uncle call'd antonio i pray thee mark me that a brother should be so perfidious he whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle dost thou attend me 

sir most heedfully 

being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who to advance and who to trash for over topping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed em or else new form'd em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts i the state to what tune pleased his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and suck'd my verdure out on't thou attend'st not 

o good sir i do 

i pray thee mark me i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired o'er prized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing dost thou hear 

your tale sir would cure deafness 

to have no screen between this part he play'd and him he play'd it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates so dry he was for sway wi the king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbow'd alas poor milan to most ignoble stooping 

o the heavens 

mark his condition and the event then tell me if this might be a brother 

i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother good wombs have borne bad sons 

now the condition the king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit which was that he in lieu o the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self 

alack for pity i not remembering how i cried out then will cry it o'er again it is a hint that wrings mine eyes to't 

hear a little further and then i'll bring thee to the present business which now's upon's without the which this story were most impertinent 

wherefore did they not that hour destroy us 

well demanded wench my tale provokes that question dear they durst not so dear the love my people bore me nor set a mark so bloody on the business but with colours fairer painted their foul ends in few they hurried us aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat not rigg'd nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively had quit it there they hoist us to cry to the sea that roar'd to us to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong 

alack what trouble was i then to you 

o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deck'd the sea with drops full salt under my burthen groan'd which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue 

how came we ashore 

by providence divine some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i loved my books he furnish'd me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom 

would i might but ever see that man 

now i arise resumes his mantle sit still and hear the last of our sea sorrow here in this island we arrived and here have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit than other princesses can that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful 

heavens thank you for't and now i pray you sir for still tis beating in my mind your reason for raising this sea storm 

know thus far forth by accident most strange bountiful fortune now my dear lady hath mine enemies brought to this shore and by my prescience i find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star whose influence if now i court not but omit my fortunes will ever after droop here cease more questions thou art inclined to sleep tis a good dulness and give it way i know thou canst not choose miranda sleeps come away servant come i am ready now approach my ariel come enter ariel

all hail great master grave sir hail i come to answer thy best pleasure be't to fly to swim to dive into the fire to ride on the curl'd clouds to thy strong bidding task ariel and all his quality 

hast thou spirit perform'd to point the tempest that i bade thee 

to every article i boarded the king's ship now on the beak now in the waist the deck in every cabin i flamed amazement sometime i'ld divide and burn in many places on the topmast the yards and bowsprit would i flame distinctly then meet and join jove's lightnings the precursors o the dreadful thunder claps more momentary and sight outrunning were not the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble yea his dread trident shake 

my brave spirit who was so firm so constant that this coil would not infect his reason 

not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and play'd some tricks of desperation all but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel then all afire with me the king's son ferdinand with hair up staring then like reeds not hair was the first man that leap'd cried hell is empty and all the devils are here 

why that's my spirit but was not this nigh shore 

close by my master 

but are they ariel safe 

not a hair perish'd on their sustaining garments not a blemish but fresher than before and as thou badest me in troops i have dispersed them bout the isle the king's son have i landed by himself whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle and sitting his arms in this sad knot 

of the king's ship the mariners say how thou hast disposed and all the rest o the fleet 

safely in harbour is the king's ship in the deep nook where once thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew from the still vex'd bermoothes there she's hid the mariners all under hatches stow'd who with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour i have left asleep and for the rest o the fleet which i dispersed they all have met again and are upon the mediterranean flote bound sadly home for naples supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd and his great person perish 

ariel thy charge exactly is perform'd but there's more work what is the time o the day 

past the mid season 

at least two glasses the time twixt six and now must by us both be spent most preciously 

is there more toil since thou dost give me pains let me remember thee what thou hast promised which is not yet perform'd me 

how now moody what is't thou canst demand 

my liberty 

before the time be out no more 

i prithee remember i have done thee worthy service told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise to bate me a full year 

dost thou forget from what a torment i did free thee 

no 

thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep to run upon the sharp wind of the north to do me business in the veins o the earth when it is baked with frost 

i do not sir 

thou liest malignant thing hast thou forgot the foul witch sycorax who with age and envy was grown into a hoop hast thou forgot her 

no sir 

thou hast where was she born speak tell me 

sir in argier 

o was she so i must once in a month recount what thou hast been which thou forget'st this damn'd witch sycorax for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing from argier thou know'st was banish'd for one thing she did they would not take her life is not this true 

ay sir 

this blue eyed hag was hither brought with child and here was left by the sailors thou my slave as thou report'st thyself wast then her servant and for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorr'd commands refusing her grand hests she did confine thee by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage into a cloven pine within which rift imprison'd thou didst painfully remain a dozen years within which space she died and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill wheels strike then was this island save for the son that she did litter here a freckled whelp hag born not honour'd with a human shape 

yes caliban her son 

dull thing i say so he that caliban whom now i keep in service thou best know'st what torment i did find thee in thy groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of ever angry bears it was a torment to lay upon the damn'd which sycorax could not again undo it was mine art when i arrived and heard thee that made gape the pine and let thee out 

i thank thee master 

if thou more murmur'st i will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howl'd away twelve winters 

pardon master i will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently 

do so and after two days i will discharge thee 

that's my noble master what shall i do say what what shall i do 

go make thyself like a nymph o the sea be subject to no sight but thine and mine invisible to every eyeball else go take this shape and hither come in't go hence with diligence exit ariel awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well awake 

the strangeness of your story put heaviness in me 

shake it off come on we'll visit caliban my slave who never yields us kind answer 

'tis a villain sir i do not love to look on 

but as tis we cannot miss him he does make our fire fetch in our wood and serves in offices that profit us what ho slave caliban thou earth thou speak 

 within there's wood enough within 

come forth i say there's other business for thee come thou tortoise when re enter ariel like a water nymph fine apparition my quaint ariel hark in thine ear 

my lord it shall be done 

thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself upon thy wicked dam come forth enter caliban

as wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd with raven's feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both a south west blow on ye and blister you all o'er 

for this be sure to night thou shalt have cramps side stitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins shall for that vast of night that they may work all exercise on thee thou shalt be pinch'd as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging than bees that made em 

i must eat my dinner this island's mine by sycorax my mother which thou takest from me when thou camest first thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me water with berries in't and teach me how to name the bigger light and how the less that burn by day and night and then i loved thee and show'd thee all the qualities o the isle the fresh springs brine pits barren place and fertile cursed be i that did so all the charms of sycorax toads beetles bats light on you for i am all the subjects that you have which first was mine own king and here you sty me in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me the rest o the island 

thou most lying slave whom stripes may move not kindness i have used thee filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate the honour of my child 

o ho o ho would't had been done thou didst prevent me i had peopled else this isle with calibans 

abhorred slave which any print of goodness wilt not take being capable of all ill i pitied thee took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour one thing or other when thou didst not savage know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like a thing most brutish i endow'd thy purposes with words that made them known but thy vile race though thou didst learn had that in't which good natures could not abide to be with therefore wast thou deservedly confined into this rock who hadst deserved more than a prison 

you taught me language and my profit on't is i know how to curse the red plague rid you for learning me your language 

hag seed hence fetch us in fuel and be quick thou'rt best to answer other business shrug'st thou malice if thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly what i command i'll rack thee with old cramps fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar that beasts shall tremble at thy din 

no pray thee aside i must obey his art is of such power it would control my dam's god setebos and make a vassal of him 

so slave hence exit caliban re enter ariel invisible playing and singing ferdinand following ariel's song come unto these yellow sands and then take hands courtsied when you have and kiss'd the wild waves whist foot it featly here and there and sweet sprites the burthen bear hark hark burthen dispersedly within the watch dogs bark burthen bow wow hark hark i hear the strain of strutting chanticleer cry cock a diddle dow 

where should this music be i the air or the earth it sounds no more and sure it waits upon some god o the island sitting on a bank weeping again the king my father's wreck this music crept by me upon the waters allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air thence i have follow'd it or it hath drawn me rather but tis gone no it begins again ariel sings full fathom five thy father lies of his bones are coral made those are pearls that were his eyes nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a sea change into something rich and strange sea nymphs hourly ring his knell burthen ding dong hark now i hear them ding dong bell 

the ditty does remember my drown'd father this is no mortal business nor no sound that the earth owes i hear it now above me 

the fringed curtains of thine eye advance and say what thou seest yond 

what is't a spirit lord how it looks about believe me sir it carries a brave form but tis a spirit 

no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses as we have such this gallant which thou seest was in the wreck and but he's something stain'd with grief that's beauty's canker thou mightst call him a goodly person he hath lost his fellows and strays about to find em 

i might call him a thing divine for nothing natural i ever saw so noble 

 aside it goes on i see as my soul prompts it spirit fine spirit i'll free thee within two days for this 

most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend vouchsafe my prayer may know if you remain upon this island and that you will some good instruction give how i may bear me here my prime request which i do last pronounce is o you wonder if you be maid or no 

no wonder sir but certainly a maid 

my language heavens i am the best of them that speak this speech were i but where tis spoken 

how the best what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee 

a single thing as i am now that wonders to hear thee speak of naples he does hear me and that he does i weep myself am naples who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld the king my father wreck'd 

alack for mercy 

yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan and his brave son being twain 

 aside the duke of milan and his more braver daughter could control thee if now twere fit to do't at the first sight they have changed eyes delicate ariel i'll set thee free for this to ferdinand a word good sir i fear you have done yourself some wrong a word 

why speaks my father so ungently this is the third man that e'er i saw the first that e'er i sigh'd for pity move my father to be inclined my way 

o if a virgin and your affection not gone forth i'll make you the queen of naples 

soft sir one word more aside they are both in either's powers but this swift business i must uneasy make lest too light winning make the prize light to ferdinand one word more i charge thee that thou attend me thou dost here usurp the name thou owest not and hast put thyself upon this island as a spy to win it from me the lord on't 

no as i am a man 

there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple if the ill spirit have so fair a house good things will strive to dwell with't 

follow me speak not you for him he's a traitor come i'll manacle thy neck and feet together sea water shalt thou drink thy food shall be the fresh brook muscles wither'd roots and husks wherein the acorn cradled follow 

no i will resist such entertainment till mine enemy has more power draws and is charmed from moving

o dear father make not too rash a trial of him for he's gentle and not fearful 

what i say my foot my tutor put thy sword up traitor who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience is so possess'd with guilt come from thy ward for i can here disarm thee with this stick and make thy weapon drop 

beseech you father 

hence hang not on my garments 

sir have pity i'll be his surety 

silence one word more shall make me chide thee if not hate thee what an advocate for an imposter hush thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he having seen but him and caliban foolish wench to the most of men this is a caliban and they to him are angels 

my affections are then most humble i have no ambition to see a goodlier man 

come on obey thy nerves are in their infancy again and have no vigour in them 

so they are my spirits as in a dream are all bound up my father's loss the weakness which i feel the wreck of all my friends nor this man's threats to whom i am subdued are but light to me might i but through my prison once a day behold this maid all corners else o the earth let liberty make use of space enough have i in such a prison 

 aside it works to ferdinand come on thou hast done well fine ariel to ferdinand follow me to ariel hark what thou else shalt do me 

be of comfort my father's of a better nature sir than he appears by speech this is unwonted which now came from him 

thou shalt be free as mountain winds but then exactly do all points of my command 

to the syllable 

come follow speak not for him 

scene i another part of the island 

enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo adrian francisco and others

beseech you sir be merry you have cause so have we all of joy for our escape is much beyond our loss our hint of woe is common every day some sailor's wife the masters of some merchant and the merchant have just our theme of woe but for the miracle i mean our preservation few in millions can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh our sorrow with our comfort 

prithee peace 

he receives comfort like cold porridge 

the visitor will not give him o'er so 

look he's winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strike 

sir 

one tell 

when every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd comes to the entertainer 

a dollar 

dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken truer than you purposed 

you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should 

therefore my lord 

fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue 

i prithee spare 

well i have done but yet 

he will be talking 

which of he or adrian for a good wager first begins to crow 

the old cock 

the cockerel 

done the wager 

a laughter 

a match 

though this island seem to be desert 

ha ha ha so you're paid 

uninhabitable and almost inaccessible 

yet 

yet 

he could not miss't 

it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance 

temperance was a delicate wench 

ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered 

the air breathes upon us here most sweetly 

as if it had lungs and rotten ones 

or as twere perfumed by a fen 

here is everything advantageous to life 

true save means to live 

of that there's none or little 

how lush and lusty the grass looks how green 

the ground indeed is tawny 

with an eye of green in't 

he misses not much 

no he doth but mistake the truth totally 

but the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit 

as many vouched rarities are 

that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new dyed than stained with salt water 

if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies 

ay or very falsely pocket up his report

methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the king's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis 

'twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return 

tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen 

not since widow dido's time 

widow a pox o that how came that widow in widow dido 

what if he had said widower aeneas too good lord how you take it 

'widow dido said you you make me study of that she was of carthage not of tunis 

this tunis sir was carthage 

carthage 

i assure you carthage 

his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath raised the wall and houses too 

what impossible matter will he make easy next 

i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple 

and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands 

ay 

why in good time 

sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now queen 

and the rarest that e'er came there 

bate i beseech you widow dido 

o widow dido ay widow dido 

is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it i mean in a sort 

that sort was well fished for 

when i wore it at your daughter's marriage 

you cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense would i had never married my daughter there for coming thence my son is lost and in my rate she too who is so far from italy removed i ne'er again shall see her o thou mine heir of naples and of milan what strange fish hath made his meal on thee 

sir he may live i saw him beat the surges under him and ride upon their backs he trod the water whose enmity he flung aside and breasted the surge most swoln that met him his bold head bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd himself with his good arms in lusty stroke to the shore that o'er his wave worn basis bow'd as stooping to relieve him i not doubt he came alive to land 

no no he's gone 

sir you may thank yourself for this great loss that would not bless our europe with your daughter but rather lose her to an african where she at least is banish'd from your eye who hath cause to wet the grief on't 

prithee peace 

you were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise by all of us and the fair soul herself weigh'd between loathness and obedience at which end o the beam should bow we have lost your son i fear for ever milan and naples have more widows in them of this business making than we bring men to comfort them the fault's your own 

so is the dear'st o the loss 

my lord sebastian the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster 

very well 

and most chirurgeonly 

it is foul weather in us all good sir when you are cloudy 

foul weather 

very foul 

had i plantation of this isle my lord 

he'ld sow't with nettle seed 

or docks or mallows 

and were the king on't what would i do 

'scape being drunk for want of wine 

i the commonwealth i would by contraries execute all things for no kind of traffic would i admit no name of magistrate letters should not be known riches poverty and use of service none contract succession bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none no use of metal corn or wine or oil no occupation all men idle all and women too but innocent and pure no sovereignty 

yet he would be king on't 

the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning 

all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavour treason felony sword pike knife gun or need of any engine would i not have but nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison all abundance to feed my innocent people 

no marrying mong his subjects 

none man all idle whores and knaves 

i would with such perfection govern sir to excel the golden age 

god save his majesty 

long live gonzalo 

and do you mark me sir 

prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me 

i do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing 

'twas you we laughed at 

who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still 

what a blow was there given 

an it had not fallen flat long 

you are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing enter ariel invisible playing solemn music

we would so and then go a bat fowling 

nay good my lord be not angry 

no i warrant you i will not adventure my discretion so weakly will you laugh me asleep for i am very heavy 

go sleep and hear us all sleep except alonso sebastian and antonio

what all so soon asleep i wish mine eyes would with themselves shut up my thoughts i find they are inclined to do so 

please you sir do not omit the heavy offer of it it seldom visits sorrow when it doth it is a comforter 

we two my lord will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety 

thank you wondrous heavy alonso sleeps exit ariel

what a strange drowsiness possesses them 

it is the quality o the climate 

why doth it not then our eyelids sink i find not myself disposed to sleep 

nor i my spirits are nimble they fell together all as by consent they dropp'd as by a thunder stroke what might worthy sebastian o what might no more and yet me thinks i see it in thy face what thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head 

what art thou waking 

do you not hear me speak 

i do and surely it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st out of thy sleep what is it thou didst say this is a strange repose to be asleep with eyes wide open standing speaking moving and yet so fast asleep 

noble sebastian thou let'st thy fortune sleep die rather wink'st whiles thou art waking 

thou dost snore distinctly there's meaning in thy snores 

i am more serious than my custom you must be so too if heed me which to do trebles thee o'er 

well i am standing water 

i'll teach you how to flow 

do so to ebb hereditary sloth instructs me 

o if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it you more invest it ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth 

prithee say on the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim a matter from thee and a birth indeed which throes thee much to yield 

thus sir although this lord of weak remembrance this who shall be of as little memory when he is earth'd hath here almost persuade for he's a spirit of persuasion only professes to persuade the king his son's alive tis as impossible that he's undrown'd and he that sleeps here swims 

i have no hope that he's undrown'd 

o out of that no hope what great hope have you no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond but doubt discovery there will you grant with me that ferdinand is drown'd 

he's gone 

then tell me who's the next heir of naples 

claribel 

she that is queen of tunis she that dwells ten leagues beyond man's life she that from naples can have no note unless the sun were post the man i the moon's too slow till new born chins be rough and razorable she that from whom we all were sea swallow'd though some cast again and by that destiny to perform an act whereof what's past is prologue what to come in yours and my discharge 

what stuff is this how say you tis true my brother's daughter's queen of tunis so is she heir of naples twixt which regions there is some space 

a space whose every cubit seems to cry out how shall that claribel measure us back to naples keep in tunis and let sebastian wake say this were death that now hath seized them why they were no worse than now they are there be that can rule naples as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate as amply and unnecessarily as this gonzalo i myself could make a chough of as deep chat o that you bore the mind that i do what a sleep were this for your advancement do you understand me 

methinks i do 

and how does your content tender your own good fortune 

i remember you did supplant your brother prospero 

true and look how well my garments sit upon me much feater than before my brother's servants were then my fellows now they are my men 

but for your conscience 

ay sir where lies that if twere a kibe twould put me to my slipper but i feel not this deity in my bosom twenty consciences that stand twixt me and milan candied be they and melt ere they molest here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon if he were that which now he's like that's dead whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus to the perpetual wink for aye might put this ancient morsel this sir prudence who should not upbraid our course for all the rest they'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk they'll tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour 

thy case dear friend shall be my precedent as thou got'st milan i'll come by naples draw thy sword one stroke shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest and i the king shall love thee 

draw together and when i rear my hand do you the like to fall it on gonzalo 

o but one word they talk apart re enter ariel invisible

my master through his art foresees the danger that you his friend are in and sends me forth for else his project dies to keep them living sings in gonzalo's ear while you here do snoring lie open eyed conspiracy his time doth take if of life you keep a care shake off slumber and beware awake awake 

then let us both be sudden 

now good angels preserve the king they wake

why how now ho awake why are you drawn wherefore this ghastly looking 

what's the matter 

whiles we stood here securing your repose even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing like bulls or rather lions did't not wake you it struck mine ear most terribly 

i heard nothing 

o twas a din to fright a monster's ear to make an earthquake sure it was the roar of a whole herd of lions 

heard you this gonzalo 

upon mine honour sir i heard a humming and that a strange one too which did awake me i shaked you sir and cried as mine eyes open'd i saw their weapons drawn there was a noise that's verily tis best we stand upon our guard or that we quit this place let's draw our weapons 

lead off this ground and let's make further search for my poor son 

heavens keep him from these beasts for he is sure i the island 

lead away

scene i before prospero's cell 

enter ferdinand bearing a log

there be some sports are painful and their labour delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone and most poor matters point to rich ends this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious but the mistress which i serve quickens what's dead and makes my labours pleasures o she is ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed and he's composed of harshness i must remove some thousands of these logs and pile them up upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness had never like executor i forget but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours most busy lest when i do it enter miranda and prospero at a distance unseen

alas now pray you work not so hard i would the lightning had burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile pray set it down and rest you when this burns twill weep for having wearied you my father is hard at study pray now rest yourself he's safe for these three hours 

o most dear mistress the sun will set before i shall discharge what i must strive to do 

if you'll sit down i'll bear your logs the while pray give me that i'll carry it to the pile 

no precious creature i had rather crack my sinews break my back than you should such dishonour undergo while i sit lazy by 

it would become me as well as it does you and i should do it with much more ease for my good will is to it and yours it is against 

poor worm thou art infected this visitation shows it 

you look wearily 

no noble mistress tis fresh morning with me when you are by at night i do beseech you chiefly that i might set it in my prayers what is your name 

miranda o my father i have broke your hest to say so 

admired miranda indeed the top of admiration worth what's dearest to the world full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage brought my too diligent ear for several virtues have i liked several women never any with so fun soul but some defect in her did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed and put it to the foil but you o you so perfect and so peerless are created of every creature's best 

i do not know one of my sex no woman's face remember save from my glass mine own nor have i seen more that i may call men than you good friend and my dear father how features are abroad i am skilless of but by my modesty the jewel in my dower i would not wish any companion in the world but you nor can imagination form a shape besides yourself to like of but i prattle something too wildly and my father's precepts i therein do forget 

i am in my condition a prince miranda i do think a king i would not so and would no more endure this wooden slavery than to suffer the flesh fly blow my mouth hear my soul speak the very instant that i saw you did my heart fly to your service there resides to make me slave to it and for your sake am i this patient log man 

do you love me 

o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound and crown what i profess with kind event if i speak true if hollowly invert what best is boded me to mischief i beyond all limit of what else i the world do love prize honour you 

i am a fool to weep at what i am glad of 

fair encounter of two most rare affections heavens rain grace on that which breeds between em 

wherefore weep you 

at mine unworthiness that dare not offer what i desire to give and much less take what i shall die to want but this is trifling and all the more it seeks to hide itself the bigger bulk it shows hence bashful cunning and prompt me plain and holy innocence i am your wife if you will marry me if not i'll die your maid to be your fellow you may deny me but i'll be your servant whether you will or no 

my mistress dearest and i thus humble ever 

my husband then 

ay with a heart as willing as bondage e'er of freedom here's my hand 

and mine with my heart in't and now farewell till half an hour hence 

a thousand thousand exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally

so glad of this as they i cannot be who are surprised withal but my rejoicing at nothing can be more i'll to my book for yet ere supper time must i perform much business appertaining 

scene ii another part of the island 

enter caliban stephano and trinculo

servant monster the folly of this island they say there's but five upon this isle we are three of them if th other two be brained like us the state totters 

drink servant monster when i bid thee thy eyes are almost set in thy head 

where should they be set else he were a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail 

my man monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack for my part the sea cannot drown me i swam ere i could recover the shore five and thirty leagues off and on by this light thou shalt be my lieutenant monster or my standard 

your lieutenant if you list he's no standard 

we'll not run monsieur monster 

nor go neither but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither 

moon calf speak once in thy life if thou beest a good moon calf 

how does thy honour let me lick thy shoe i'll not serve him he's not valiant 

thou liest most ignorant monster i am in case to justle a constable why thou deboshed fish thou was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as i to day wilt thou tell a monstrous lie being but half a fish and half a monster 

lo how he mocks me wilt thou let him my lord 

'lord quoth he that a monster should be such a natural 

lo lo again bite him to death i prithee 

trinculo keep a good tongue in your head if you prove a mutineer the next tree the poor monster's my subject and he shall not suffer indignity 

i thank my noble lord wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit i made to thee 

marry will i kneel and repeat it i will stand and so shall trinculo enter ariel invisible

as i told thee before i am subject to a tyrant a sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island 

thou liest 

thou liest thou jesting monkey thou i would my valiant master would destroy thee i do not lie 

trinculo if you trouble him any more in's tale by this hand i will supplant some of your teeth 

why i said nothing 

mum then and no more proceed 

i say by sorcery he got this isle from me he got it if thy greatness will revenge it on him for i know thou darest but this thing dare not 

that's most certain 

thou shalt be lord of it and i'll serve thee 

how now shall this be compassed canst thou bring me to the party 

yea yea my lord i'll yield him thee asleep where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead 

thou liest thou canst not 

what a pied ninny's this thou scurvy patch i do beseech thy greatness give him blows and take his bottle from him when that's gone he shall drink nought but brine for i'll not show him where the quick freshes are 

trinculo run into no further danger interrupt the monster one word further and by this hand i'll turn my mercy out o doors and make a stock fish of thee 

why what did i i did nothing i'll go farther off 

didst thou not say he lied 

thou liest 

do i so take thou that beats trinculo as you like this give me the lie another time 

i did not give the lie out o your wits and bearing too a pox o your bottle this can sack and drinking do a murrain on your monster and the devil take your fingers 

ha ha ha 

now forward with your tale prithee stand farther off 

beat him enough after a little time i'll beat him too 

stand farther come proceed 

why as i told thee tis a custom with him i th afternoon to sleep there thou mayst brain him having first seized his books or with a log batter his skull or paunch him with a stake or cut his wezand with thy knife remember first to possess his books for without them he's but a sot as i am nor hath not one spirit to command they all do hate him as rootedly as i burn but his books he has brave utensils for so he calls them which when he has a house he'll deck withal and that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter he himself calls her a nonpareil i never saw a woman but only sycorax my dam and she but she as far surpasseth sycorax as great'st does least 

is it so brave a lass 

ay lord she will become thy bed i warrant and bring thee forth brave brood 

monster i will kill this man his daughter and i will be king and queen save our graces and trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys dost thou like the plot trinculo 

excellent 

give me thy hand i am sorry i beat thee but while thou livest keep a good tongue in thy head 

within this half hour will he be asleep wilt thou destroy him then 

ay on mine honour 

this will i tell my master 

thou makest me merry i am full of pleasure let us be jocund will you troll the catch you taught me but while ere 

at thy request monster i will do reason any reason come on trinculo let us sing sings flout em and scout em and scout em and flout em thought is free 

that's not the tune ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe

what is this same 

this is the tune of our catch played by the picture of nobody 

if thou beest a man show thyself in thy likeness if thou beest a devil take't as thou list 

o forgive me my sins 

he that dies pays all debts i defy thee mercy upon us 

art thou afeard 

no monster not i 

be not afeard the isle is full of noises sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears and sometime voices that if i then had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again and then in dreaming the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when i waked i cried to dream again 

this will prove a brave kingdom to me where i shall have my music for nothing 

when prospero is destroyed 

that shall be by and by i remember the story 

the sound is going away let's follow it and after do our work 

lead monster we'll follow i would i could see this tabourer he lays it on 

wilt come i'll follow stephano 

scene iii another part of the island 

enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo adrian francisco and others

by'r lakin i can go no further sir my old bones ache here's a maze trod indeed through forth rights and meanders by your patience i needs must rest me 

old lord i cannot blame thee who am myself attach'd with weariness to the dulling of my spirits sit down and rest even here i will put off my hope and keep it no longer for my flatterer he is drown'd whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks our frustrate search on land well let him go 

 aside to sebastian i am right glad that he's so out of hope do not for one repulse forego the purpose that you resolved to effect 

 aside to antonio the next advantage will we take throughly 

 aside to sebastian let it be to night for now they are oppress'd with travel they will not nor cannot use such vigilance as when they are fresh 

 aside to antonio i say to night no more solemn and strange music

what harmony is this my good friends hark 

marvellous sweet music enter prospero above invisible enter several strange shapes bringing in a banquet they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation and inviting the king and c to eat they depart

give us kind keepers heavens what were these 

a living drollery now i will believe that there are unicorns that in arabia there is one tree the phoenix throne one phoenix at this hour reigning there 

i'll believe both and what does else want credit come to me and i'll be sworn tis true travellers ne'er did lie though fools at home condemn em 

if in naples i should report this now would they believe me if i should say i saw such islanders for certes these are people of the island who though they are of monstrous shape yet note their manners are more gentle kind than of our human generation you shall find many nay almost any 

 aside honest lord thou hast said well for some of you there present are worse than devils 

i cannot too much muse such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing although they want the use of tongue a kind of excellent dumb discourse 

 aside praise in departing 

they vanish'd strangely 

no matter since they have left their viands behind for we have stomachs will't please you taste of what is here 

not i 

faith sir you need not fear when we were boys who would believe that there were mountaineers dew lapp'd like bulls whose throats had hanging at em wallets of flesh or that there were such men whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find each putter out of five for one will bring us good warrant of 

i will stand to and feed although my last no matter since i feel the best is past brother my lord the duke stand to and do as we thunder and lightning enter ariel like a harpy claps his wings upon the table and with a quaint device the banquet vanishes

you are three men of sin whom destiny that hath to instrument this lower world and what is in't the never surfeited sea hath caused to belch up you and on this island where man doth not inhabit you mongst men being most unfit to live i have made you mad and even with such like valour men hang and drown their proper selves alonso sebastian and c draw their swords you fools i and my fellows are ministers of fate the elements of whom your swords are temper'd may as well wound the loud winds or with bemock'd at stabs kill the still closing waters as diminish one dowle that's in my plume my fellow ministers are like invulnerable if you could hurt your swords are now too massy for your strengths and will not be uplifted but remember for that's my business to you that you three from milan did supplant good prospero exposed unto the sea which hath requit it him and his innocent child for which foul deed the powers delaying not forgetting have incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures against your peace thee of thy son alonso they have bereft and do pronounce by me lingering perdition worse than any death can be at once shall step by step attend you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from which here in this most desolate isle else falls upon your heads is nothing but heart sorrow and a clear life ensuing he vanishes in thunder then to soft music enter the shapes again and dance with mocks and mows and carrying out the table

bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou perform'd my ariel a grace it had devouring of my instruction hast thou nothing bated in what thou hadst to say so with good life and observation strange my meaner ministers their several kinds have done my high charms work and these mine enemies are all knit up in their distractions they now are in my power and in these fits i leave them while i visit young ferdinand whom they suppose is drown'd and his and mine loved darling exit above

i the name of something holy sir why stand you in this strange stare 

o it is monstrous monstrous methought the billows spoke and told me of it the winds did sing it to me and the thunder that deep and dreadful organ pipe pronounced the name of prosper it did bass my trespass therefore my son i the ooze is bedded and i'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded and with him there lie mudded 

but one fiend at a time i'll fight their legions o'er 

i'll be thy second exeunt sebastian and antonio

all three of them are desperate their great guilt like poison given to work a great time after now gins to bite the spirits i do beseech you that are of suppler joints follow them swiftly and hinder them from what this ecstasy may now provoke them to 

follow i pray you 

scene i before prospero's cell 

enter prospero ferdinand and miranda

if i have too austerely punish'd you your compensation makes amends for i have given you here a third of mine own life or that for which i live who once again i tender to thy hand all thy vexations were but my trials of thy love and thou hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven i ratify this my rich gift o ferdinand do not smile at me that i boast her off for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise and make it halt behind her 

i do believe it against an oracle 

then as my gift and thine own acquisition worthily purchased take my daughter but if thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be minister'd no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow but barren hate sour eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both therefore take heed as hymen's lamps shall light you 

as i hope for quiet days fair issue and long life with such love as tis now the murkiest den the most opportune place the strong'st suggestion our worser genius can shall never melt mine honour into lust to take away the edge of that day's celebration when i shall think or phoebus steeds are founder'd or night kept chain'd below 

fairly spoke sit then and talk with her she is thine own what ariel my industrious servant ariel enter ariel

what would my potent master here i am 

thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform and i must use you in such another trick go bring the rabble o'er whom i give thee power here to this place incite them to quick motion for i must bestow upon the eyes of this young couple some vanity of mine art it is my promise and they expect it from me 

presently 

ay with a twink 

before you can say come and go and breathe twice and cry so so each one tripping on his toe will be here with mop and mow do you love me master no 

dearly my delicate ariel do not approach till thou dost hear me call 

well i conceive 

look thou be true do not give dalliance too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw to the fire i the blood be more abstemious or else good night your vow 

i warrant you sir the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardour of my liver 

well now come my ariel bring a corollary rather than want a spirit appear and pertly no tongue all eyes be silent soft music enter iris

ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas of wheat rye barley vetches oats and pease thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep and flat meads thatch'd with stover them to keep thy banks with pioned and twilled brims which spongy april at thy hest betrims to make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves being lass lorn thy pole clipt vineyard and thy sea marge sterile and rocky hard where thou thyself dost air the queen o the sky whose watery arch and messenger am i bids thee leave these and with her sovereign grace here on this grass plot in this very place to come and sport her peacocks fly amain approach rich ceres her to entertain enter ceres

hail many colour'd messenger that ne'er dost disobey the wife of jupiter who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers diffusest honey drops refreshing showers and with each end of thy blue bow dost crown my bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down rich scarf to my proud earth why hath thy queen summon'd me hither to this short grass'd green 

a contract of true love to celebrate and some donation freely to estate on the blest lovers 

tell me heavenly bow if venus or her son as thou dost know do now attend the queen since they did plot the means that dusky dis my daughter got her and her blind boy's scandal'd company i have forsworn 

of her society be not afraid i met her deity cutting the clouds towards paphos and her son dove drawn with her here thought they to have done some wanton charm upon this man and maid whose vows are that no bed right shall be paid till hymen's torch be lighted but vain mars's hot minion is returned again her waspish headed son has broke his arrows swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows and be a boy right out 

high'st queen of state great juno comes i know her by her gait enter juno

how does my bounteous sister go with me to bless this twain that they may prosperous be and honour'd in their issue they sing 

honour riches marriage blessing long continuance and increasing hourly joys be still upon you juno sings her blessings upon you 

earth's increase foison plenty barns and garners never empty vines and clustering bunches growing plants with goodly burthen bowing spring come to you at the farthest in the very end of harvest scarcity and want shall shun you ceres blessing so is on you 

this is a most majestic vision and harmoniously charmingly may i be bold to think these spirits 

spirits which by mine art i have from their confines call'd to enact my present fancies 

let me live here ever so rare a wonder'd father and a wife makes this place paradise juno and ceres whisper and send iris on employment

sweet now silence juno and ceres whisper seriously there's something else to do hush and be mute or else our spell is marr'd 

you nymphs call'd naiads of the windring brooks with your sedged crowns and ever harmless looks leave your crisp channels and on this green land answer your summons juno does command come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate a contract of true love be not too late enter certain nymphs you sunburnt sicklemen of august weary come hither from the furrow and be merry make holiday your rye straw hats put on and these fresh nymphs encounter every one in country footing enter certain reapers properly habited they join with the nymphs in a graceful dance towards the end whereof prospero starts suddenly and speaks after which to a strange hollow and confused noise they heavily vanish

 aside i had forgot that foul conspiracy of the beast caliban and his confederates against my life the minute of their plot is almost come to the spirits well done avoid no more 

this is strange your father's in some passion that works him strongly 

never till this day saw i him touch'd with anger so distemper'd 

you do look my son in a moved sort as if you were dismay'd be cheerful sir our revels now are ended these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloud capp'd towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself ye all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep sir i am vex'd bear with my weakness my brain is troubled be not disturb'd with my infirmity if you be pleased retire into my cell and there repose a turn or two i'll walk to still my beating mind 

miranda

we wish your peace 

come with a thought i thank thee ariel come enter ariel

thy thoughts i cleave to what's thy pleasure 

spirit we must prepare to meet with caliban 

ay my commander when i presented ceres i thought to have told thee of it but i fear'd lest i might anger thee 

say again where didst thou leave these varlets 

i told you sir they were red hot with drinking so fun of valour that they smote the air for breathing in their faces beat the ground for kissing of their feet yet always bending towards their project then i beat my tabour at which like unback'd colts they prick'd their ears advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses as they smelt music so i charm'd their ears that calf like they my lowing follow'd through tooth'd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns which entered their frail shins at last i left them i the filthy mantled pool beyond your cell there dancing up to the chins that the foul lake o'erstunk their feet 

this was well done my bird thy shape invisible retain thou still the trumpery in my house go bring it hither for stale to catch these thieves 

i go i go

hey mountain hey

fury fury there tyrant there hark hark caliban stephano and trinculo are driven out go charge my goblins that they grind their joints with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews with aged cramps and more pinch spotted make them than pard or cat o mountain 

hark they roar 

let them be hunted soundly at this hour lie at my mercy all mine enemies shortly shall all my labours end and thou shalt have the air at freedom for a little follow and do me service 

scene i before prospero's cell 

enter prospero in his magic robes and ariel

now does my project gather to a head my charms crack not my spirits obey and time goes upright with his carriage how's the day 

on the sixth hour at which time my lord you said our work should cease 

i did say so when first i raised the tempest say my spirit how fares the king and's followers 

confined together in the same fashion as you gave in charge just as you left them all prisoners sir in the line grove which weather fends your cell they cannot budge till your release the king his brother and yours abide all three distracted and the remainder mourning over them brimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly him that you term'd sir the good old lord gonzalo his tears run down his beard like winter's drops from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works em that if you now beheld them your affections would become tender 

dost thou think so spirit 

mine would sir were i human 

and mine shall hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling of their afflictions and shall not myself one of their kind that relish all as sharply passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art though with their high wrongs i am struck to the quick yet with my nobler reason gaitist my fury do i take part the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent the sole drift of my purpose doth extend not a frown further go release them ariel my charms i'll break their senses i'll restore and they shall be themselves 

i'll fetch them sir 

ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves and ye that on the sands with printless foot do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him when he comes back you demi puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid weak masters though ye be i have bedimm'd the noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds and twixt the green sea and the azured vault set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire and rifted jove's stout oak with his own bolt the strong based promontory have i made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up the pine and cedar graves at my command have waked their sleepers oped and let em forth by my so potent art but this rough magic i here abjure and when i have required some heavenly music which even now i do to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for i'll break my staff bury it certain fathoms in the earth and deeper than did ever plummet sound i'll drown my book solemn music re enter ariel before then alonso with a frantic gesture attended by gonzalo sebastian and antonio in like manner attended by adrian and francisco they all enter the circle which prospero had made and there stand charmed which prospero observing speaks a solemn air and the best comforter to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains now useless boil'd within thy skull there stand for you are spell stopp'd holy gonzalo honourable man mine eyes even sociable to the show of thine fall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apace and as the morning steals upon the night melting the darkness so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason o good gonzalo my true preserver and a loyal sir to him you follow'st i will pay thy graces home both in word and deed most cruelly didst thou alonso use me and my daughter thy brother was a furtherer in the act thou art pinch'd fort now sebastian flesh and blood you brother mine that entertain'd ambition expell'd remorse and nature who with sebastian whose inward pinches therefore are most strong would here have kill'd your king i do forgive thee unnatural though thou art their understanding begins to swell and the approaching tide will shortly fill the reasonable shore that now lies foul and muddy not one of them that yet looks on me or would know me ariel fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell i will discase me and myself present as i was sometime milan quickly spirit thou shalt ere long be free ariel sings and helps to attire him where the bee sucks there suck i in a cowslip's bell i lie there i couch when owls do cry on the bat's back i do fly after summer merrily merrily merrily shall i live now under the blossom that hangs on the bough 

why that's my dainty ariel i shall miss thee but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so to the king's ship invisible as thou art there shalt thou find the mariners asleep under the hatches the master and the boatswain being awake enforce them to this place and presently i prithee 

i drink the air before me and return or ere your pulse twice beat 

all torment trouble wonder and amazement inhabits here some heavenly power guide us out of this fearful country 

behold sir king the wronged duke of milan prospero for more assurance that a living prince does now speak to thee i embrace thy body and to thee and thy company i bid a hearty welcome 

whether thou best he or no or some enchanted trifle to abuse me as late i have been i not know thy pulse beats as of flesh and blood and since i saw thee the affliction of my mind amends with which i fear a madness held me this must crave an if this be at all a most strange story thy dukedom i resign and do entreat thou pardon me my wrongs but how should prospero be living and be here 

first noble friend let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot be measured or confined 

whether this be or be not i'll not swear 

you do yet taste some subtilties o the isle that will not let you believe things certain welcome my friends all aside to sebastian and antonio but you my brace of lords were i so minded i here could pluck his highness frown upon you and justify you traitors at this time i will tell no tales 

 aside the devil speaks in him 

no for you most wicked sir whom to call brother would even infect my mouth i do forgive thy rankest fault all of them and require my dukedom of thee which perforce i know thou must restore 

if thou be'st prospero give us particulars of thy preservation how thou hast met us here who three hours since were wreck'd upon this shore where i have lost how sharp the point of this remembrance is my dear son ferdinand 

i am woe for't sir 

irreparable is the loss and patience says it is past her cure 

i rather think you have not sought her help of whose soft grace for the like loss i have her sovereign aid and rest myself content 

you the like loss 

as great to me as late and supportable to make the dear loss have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you for i have lost my daughter 

a daughter o heavens that they were living both in naples the king and queen there that they were i wish myself were mudded in that oozy bed where my son lies when did you lose your daughter 

in this last tempest i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth their words are natural breath but howsoe'er you have been justled from your senses know for certain that i am prospero and that very duke which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely upon this shore where you were wreck'd was landed to be the lord on't no more yet of this for tis a chronicle of day by day not a relation for a breakfast nor befitting this first meeting welcome sir this cell's my court here have i few attendants and subjects none abroad pray you look in my dukedom since you have given me again i will requite you with as good a thing at least bring forth a wonder to content ye as much as me my dukedom here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda playing at chess

sweet lord you play me false 

no my dear'st love i would not for the world 

yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle and i would call it fair play 

if this prove a vision of the island one dear son shall i twice lose 

a most high miracle 

though the seas threaten they are merciful i have cursed them without cause kneels

now all the blessings of a glad father compass thee about arise and say how thou camest here 

o wonder how many goodly creatures are there here how beauteous mankind is o brave new world that has such people in't 

'tis new to thee 

what is this maid with whom thou wast at play your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours is she the goddess that hath sever'd us and brought us thus together 

sir she is mortal but by immortal providence she's mine i chose her when i could not ask my father for his advice nor thought i had one she is daughter to this famous duke of milan of whom so often i have heard renown but never saw before of whom i have received a second life and second father this lady makes him to me 

i am hers but o how oddly will it sound that i must ask my child forgiveness 

there sir stop let us not burthen our remembrance with a heaviness that's gone 

i have inly wept or should have spoke ere this look down you god and on this couple drop a blessed crown for it is you that have chalk'd forth the way which brought us hither 

i say amen gonzalo 

was milan thrust from milan that his issue should become kings of naples o rejoice beyond a common joy and set it down with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage did claribel her husband find at tunis and ferdinand her brother found a wife where he himself was lost prospero his dukedom in a poor isle and all of us ourselves when no man was his own 

 to ferdinand and miranda give me your hands let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart that doth not wish you joy 

be it so amen re enter ariel with the master and boatswain amazedly following o look sir look sir here is more of us i prophesied if a gallows were on land this fellow could not drown now blasphemy that swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore hast thou no mouth by land what is the news 

boatswain

the best news is that we have safely found our king and company the next our ship which but three glasses since we gave out split is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when we first put out to sea 

 aside to prospero sir all this service have i done since i went 

 aside to ariel my tricksy spirit 

these are not natural events they strengthen from strange to stranger say how came you hither 

boatswain

if i did think sir i were well awake i'ld strive to tell you we were dead of sleep and how we know not all clapp'd under hatches where but even now with strange and several noises of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains and more diversity of sounds all horrible we were awaked straightway at liberty where we in all her trim freshly beheld our royal good and gallant ship our master capering to eye her on a trice so please you even in a dream were we divided from them and were brought moping hither 

 aside to prospero was't well done 

 aside to ariel bravely my diligence thou shalt be free 

this is as strange a maze as e'er men trod and there is in this business more than nature was ever conduct of some oracle must rectify our knowledge 

sir my liege do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business at pick'd leisure which shall be shortly single i'll resolve you which to you shall seem probable of every these happen'd accidents till when be cheerful and think of each thing well aside to ariel come hither spirit set caliban and his companions free untie the spell exit ariel how fares my gracious sir there are yet missing of your company some few odd lads that you remember not re enter ariel driving in caliban stephano and trinculo in their stolen apparel

every man shift for all the rest and let no man take care for himself for all is but fortune coragio bully monster coragio 

if these be true spies which i wear in my head here's a goodly sight 

o setebos these be brave spirits indeed how fine my master is i am afraid he will chastise me 

ha ha what things are these my lord antonio will money buy em 

very like one of them is a plain fish and no doubt marketable 

mark but the badges of these men my lords then say if they be true this mis shapen knave his mother was a witch and one so strong that could control the moon make flows and ebbs and deal in her command without her power these three have robb'd me and this demi devil for he's a bastard one had plotted with them to take my life two of these fellows you must know and own this thing of darkness acknowledge mine 

i shall be pinch'd to death 

is not this stephano my drunken butler 

he is drunk now where had he wine 

and trinculo is reeling ripe where should they find this grand liquor that hath gilded em how camest thou in this pickle 

i have been in such a pickle since i saw you last that i fear me will never out of my bones i shall not fear fly blowing 

why how now stephano 

o touch me not i am not stephano but a cramp 

you'ld be king o the isle sirrah 

i should have been a sore one then 

this is a strange thing as e'er i look'd on pointing to caliban

he is as disproportion'd in his manners as in his shape go sirrah to my cell take with you your companions as you look to have my pardon trim it handsomely 

ay that i will and i'll be wise hereafter and seek for grace what a thrice double ass was i to take this drunkard for a god and worship this dull fool 

go to away 

hence and bestow your luggage where you found it 

or stole it rather exeunt caliban stephano and trinculo

sir i invite your highness and your train to my poor cell where you shall take your rest for this one night which part of it i'll waste with such discourse as i not doubt shall make it go quick away the story of my life and the particular accidents gone by since i came to this isle and in the morn i'll bring you to your ship and so to naples where i have hope to see the nuptial of these our dear beloved solemnized and thence retire me to my milan where every third thought shall be my grave 

i long to hear the story of your life which must take the ear strangely 

i'll deliver all and promise you calm seas auspicious gales and sail so expeditious that shall catch your royal fleet far off aside to ariel my ariel chick that is thy charge then to the elements be free and fare thou well please you draw near epilogue spoken by prospero now my charms are all o'erthrown and what strength i have's mine own which is most faint now tis true i must be here confined by you or sent to naples let me not since i have my dukedom got and pardon'd the deceiver dwell in this bare island by your spell but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands gentle breath of yours my sails must fill or else my project fails which was to please now i want spirits to enforce art to enchant and my ending is despair unless i be relieved by prayer which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults as you from crimes would pardon'd be let your indulgence set me free
