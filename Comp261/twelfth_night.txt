twelfth night

scene i duke orsino's palace 

enter duke orsino curio and other lords musicians attending

if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die that strain again it had a dying fall o it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets stealing and giving odour enough no more tis not so sweet now as it was before o spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou that notwithstanding thy capacity receiveth as the sea nought enters there of what validity and pitch soe'er but falls into abatement and low price even in a minute so full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical 

will you go hunt my lord 

what curio 

the hart 

why so i do the noblest that i have o when mine eyes did see olivia first methought she purged the air of pestilence that instant was i turn'd into a hart and my desires like fell and cruel hounds e'er since pursue me enter valentine how now what news from her 

so please my lord i might not be admitted but from her handmaid do return this answer the element itself till seven years heat shall not behold her face at ample view but like a cloistress she will veiled walk and water once a day her chamber round with eye offending brine all this to season a brother's dead love which she would keep fresh and lasting in her sad remembrance 

o she that hath a heart of that fine frame to pay this debt of love but to a brother how will she love when the rich golden shaft hath kill'd the flock of all affections else that live in her when liver brain and heart these sovereign thrones are all supplied and fill'd her sweet perfections with one self king away before me to sweet beds of flowers love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers 

scene ii the sea coast 

enter viola a captain and sailors

what country friends is this 

captain

this is illyria lady 

and what should i do in illyria my brother he is in elysium perchance he is not drown'd what think you sailors 

captain

it is perchance that you yourself were saved 

o my poor brother and so perchance may he be 

captain

true madam and to comfort you with chance assure yourself after our ship did split when you and those poor number saved with you hung on our driving boat i saw your brother most provident in peril bind himself courage and hope both teaching him the practise to a strong mast that lived upon the sea where like arion on the dolphin's back i saw him hold acquaintance with the waves so long as i could see 

for saying so there's gold mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope whereto thy speech serves for authority the like of him know'st thou this country 

captain

ay madam well for i was bred and born not three hours travel from this very place 

who governs here 

captain

a noble duke in nature as in name 

what is the name 

captain

orsino 

orsino i have heard my father name him he was a bachelor then 

captain

and so is now or was so very late for but a month ago i went from hence and then twas fresh in murmur as you know what great ones do the less will prattle of that he did seek the love of fair olivia 

what's she 

captain

a virtuous maid the daughter of a count that died some twelvemonth since then leaving her in the protection of his son her brother who shortly also died for whose dear love they say she hath abjured the company and sight of men 

o that i served that lady and might not be delivered to the world till i had made mine own occasion mellow what my estate is 

captain

that were hard to compass because she will admit no kind of suit no not the duke's 

there is a fair behavior in thee captain and though that nature with a beauteous wall doth oft close in pollution yet of thee i will believe thou hast a mind that suits with this thy fair and outward character i prithee and i'll pay thee bounteously conceal me what i am and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent i'll serve this duke thou shall present me as an eunuch to him it may be worth thy pains for i can sing and speak to him in many sorts of music that will allow me very worth his service what else may hap to time i will commit only shape thou thy silence to my wit 

captain

be you his eunuch and your mute i'll be when my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see 

i thank thee lead me on 

scene iii olivia's house 

enter sir toby belch and maria

what a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus i am sure care's an enemy to life 

by my troth sir toby you must come in earlier o nights your cousin my lady takes great exceptions to your ill hours 

why let her except before excepted 

ay but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order 

confine i'll confine myself no finer than i am these clothes are good enough to drink in and so be these boots too an they be not let them hang themselves in their own straps 

that quaffing and drinking will undo you i heard my lady talk of it yesterday and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer 

who sir andrew aguecheek 

ay he 

he's as tall a man as any's in illyria 

what's that to the purpose 

why he has three thousand ducats a year 

ay but he'll have but a year in all these ducats he's a very fool and a prodigal 

fie that you'll say so he plays o the viol de gamboys and speaks three or four languages word for word without book and hath all the good gifts of nature 

he hath indeed almost natural for besides that he's a fool he's a great quarreller and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave 

by this hand they are scoundrels and subtractors that say so of him who are they 

they that add moreover he's drunk nightly in your company 

with drinking healths to my niece i'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in illyria he's a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o the toe like a parish top what wench castiliano vulgo for here comes sir andrew agueface enter sir andrew

sir toby belch how now sir toby belch 

sweet sir andrew 

bless you fair shrew 

and you too sir

by my troth i would not undertake her in this company is that the meaning of accost 

fare you well gentlemen 

an thou let part so sir andrew would thou mightst never draw sword again 

an you part so mistress i would i might never draw sword again fair lady do you think you have fools in hand 

sir i have not you by the hand 

marry but you shall have and here's my hand 

now sir thought is free i pray you bring your hand to the buttery bar and let it drink 

wherefore sweet heart what's your metaphor 

it's dry sir 

why i think so i am not such an ass but i can keep my hand dry but what's your jest 

a dry jest sir 

are you full of them 

ay sir i have them at my fingers ends marry now i let go your hand i am barren 

o knight thou lackest a cup of canary when did i see thee so put down 

never in your life i think unless you see canary put me down methinks sometimes i have no more wit than a christian or an ordinary man has but i am a great eater of beef and i believe that does harm to my wit 

no question 

an i thought that i'ld forswear it i'll ride home to morrow sir toby 

pourquoi my dear knight 

what is pourquoi do or not do i would i had bestowed that time in the tongues that i have in fencing dancing and bear baiting o had i but followed the arts 

then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair 

why would that have mended my hair 

past question for thou seest it will not curl by nature 

but it becomes me well enough does't not 

excellent it hangs like flax on a distaff and i hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off 

faith i'll home to morrow sir toby your niece will not be seen or if she be it's four to one she'll none of me the count himself here hard by woos her 

she'll none o the count she'll not match above her degree neither in estate years nor wit i have heard her swear't tut there's life in't man 

i'll stay a month longer i am a fellow o the strangest mind i the world i delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether 

art thou good at these kickshawses knight 

as any man in illyria whatsoever he be under the degree of my betters and yet i will not compare with an old man 

what is thy excellence in a galliard knight 

faith i can cut a caper 

and i can cut the mutton to't 

and i think i have the back trick simply as strong as any man in illyria 

wherefore are these things hid wherefore have these gifts a curtain before em are they like to take dust like mistress mall's picture why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto my very walk should be a jig i would not so much as make water but in a sink a pace what dost thou mean is it a world to hide virtues in i did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was formed under the star of a galliard 

ay tis strong and it does indifferent well in a flame coloured stock shall we set about some revels 

what shall we do else were we not born under taurus 

taurus that's sides and heart 

no sir it is legs and thighs let me see the caper ha higher ha ha excellent 

scene iv duke orsino's palace 

enter valentine and viola in man's attire

if the duke continue these favours towards you cesario you are like to be much advanced he hath known you but three days and already you are no stranger 

you either fear his humour or my negligence that you call in question the continuance of his love is he inconstant sir in his favours 

no believe me 

i thank you here comes the count enter duke orsino curio and attendants

who saw cesario ho 

on your attendance my lord here 

stand you a while aloof cesario thou know'st no less but all i have unclasp'd to thee the book even of my secret soul therefore good youth address thy gait unto her be not denied access stand at her doors and tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow till thou have audience 

sure my noble lord if she be so abandon'd to her sorrow as it is spoke she never will admit me 

be clamorous and leap all civil bounds rather than make unprofited return 

say i do speak with her my lord what then 

o then unfold the passion of my love surprise her with discourse of my dear faith it shall become thee well to act my woes she will attend it better in thy youth than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect 

i think not so my lord 

dear lad believe it for they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man diana's lip is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe is as the maiden's organ shrill and sound and all is semblative a woman's part i know thy constellation is right apt for this affair some four or five attend him all if you will for i myself am best when least in company prosper well in this and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord to call his fortunes thine 

i'll do my best to woo your lady aside yet a barful strife whoe'er i woo myself would be his wife 

scene v olivia's house 

enter maria and clown

nay either tell me where thou hast been or i will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse my lady will hang thee for thy absence 

clown

let her hang me he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours 

make that good 

clown

he shall see none to fear 

a good lenten answer i can tell thee where that saying was born of i fear no colours 

clown

where good mistress mary 

in the wars and that may you be bold to say in your foolery 

clown

well god give them wisdom that have it and those that are fools let them use their talents 

yet you will be hanged for being so long absent or to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you 

clown

many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage and for turning away let summer bear it out 

you are resolute then 

clown

not so neither but i am resolved on two points 

that if one break the other will hold or if both break your gaskins fall 

clown

apt in good faith very apt well go thy way if sir toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a piece of eve's flesh as any in illyria 

peace you rogue no more o that here comes my lady make your excuse wisely you were best 

clown

wit an't be thy will put me into good fooling those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools and i that am sure i lack thee may pass for a wise man for what says quinapalus better a witty fool than a foolish wit enter olivia with malvolio god bless thee lady 

take the fool away 

clown

do you not hear fellows take away the lady 

go to you're a dry fool i'll no more of you besides you grow dishonest 

clown

two faults madonna that drink and good counsel will amend for give the dry fool drink then is the fool not dry bid the dishonest man mend himself if he mend he is no longer dishonest if he cannot let the botcher mend him any thing that's mended is but patched virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that amends is but patched with virtue if that this simple syllogism will serve so if it will not what remedy as there is no true cuckold but calamity so beauty's a flower the lady bade take away the fool therefore i say again take her away 

sir i bade them take away you 

clown

misprision in the highest degree lady cucullus non facit monachum that's as much to say as i wear not motley in my brain good madonna give me leave to prove you a fool 

can you do it 

clown

dexterously good madonna 

make your proof 

clown

clown

the more fool madonna to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven take away the fool gentlemen 

what think you of this fool malvolio doth he not mend 

yes and shall do till the pangs of death shake him infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the better fool 

clown

god send you sir a speedy infirmity for the better increasing your folly sir toby will be sworn that i am no fox but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool 

how say you to that malvolio 

i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal i saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone look you now he's out of his guard already unless you laugh and minister occasion to him he is gagged i protest i take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools zanies 

oh you are sick of self love malvolio and taste with a distempered appetite to be generous guiltless and of free disposition is to take those things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets there is no slander in an allowed fool though he do nothing but rail nor no railing in a known discreet man though he do nothing but reprove 

clown

speak to me i shall answer for her your will 

most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beauty i pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house for i never saw her i would be loath to cast away my speech for besides that it is excellently well penned i have taken great pains to con it good beauties let me sustain no scorn i am very comptible even to the least sinister usage 

whence came you sir 

i can say little more than i have studied and that question's out of my part good gentle one give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house that i may proceed in my speech 

are you a comedian 

no my profound heart and yet by the very fangs of malice i swear i am not that i play are you the lady of the house 

if i do not usurp myself i am 

most certain if you are she you do usurp yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve but this is from my commission i will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message 

come to what is important in't i forgive you the praise 

alas i took great pains to study it and tis poetical 

it is the more like to be feigned i pray you keep it in i heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you if you be not mad be gone if you have reason be brief tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue 

will you hoist sail sir here lies your way 

no good swabber i am to hull here a little longer some mollification for your giant sweet lady tell me your mind i am a messenger 

sure you have some hideous matter to deliver when the courtesy of it is so fearful speak your office 

it alone concerns your ear i bring no overture of war no taxation of homage i hold the olive in my hand my words are as fun of peace as matter 

yet you began rudely what are you what would you 

the rudeness that hath appeared in me have i learned from my entertainment what i am and what i would are as secret as maidenhead to your ears divinity to any other's profanation 

give us the place alone we will hear this divinity exeunt maria and attendants now sir what is your text 

most sweet lady 

a comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it where lies your text 

in orsino's bosom 

in his bosom in what chapter of his bosom 

to answer by the method in the first of his heart 

o i have read it it is heresy have you no more to say 

good madam let me see your face 

have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face you are now out of your text but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture look you sir such a one i was this present is't not well done unveiling

excellently done if god did all 

'tis in grain sir twill endure wind and weather 

'tis beauty truly blent whose red and white nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on lady you are the cruell'st she alive if you will lead these graces to the grave and leave the world no copy 

o sir i will not be so hard hearted i will give out divers schedules of my beauty it shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labelled to my will as item two lips indifferent red item two grey eyes with lids to them item one neck one chin and so forth were you sent hither to praise me 

i see you what you are you are too proud but if you were the devil you are fair my lord and master loves you o such love could be but recompensed though you were crown'd the nonpareil of beauty 

how does he love me 

with adorations fertile tears with groans that thunder love with sighs of fire 

your lord does know my mind i cannot love him yet i suppose him virtuous know him noble of great estate of fresh and stainless youth in voices well divulged free learn'd and valiant and in dimension and the shape of nature a gracious person but yet i cannot love him he might have took his answer long ago 

if i did love you in my master's flame with such a suffering such a deadly life in your denial i would find no sense i would not understand it 

why what would you 

make me a willow cabin at your gate and call upon my soul within the house write loyal cantons of contemned love and sing them loud even in the dead of night halloo your name to the reverberate hills and make the babbling gossip of the air cry out olivia o you should not rest between the elements of air and earth but you should pity me 

you might do much what is your parentage 

above my fortunes yet my state is well i am a gentleman 

get you to your lord i cannot love him let him send no more unless perchance you come to me again to tell me how he takes it fare you well i thank you for your pains spend this for me 

i am no fee'd post lady keep your purse my master not myself lacks recompense love make his heart of flint that you shall love and let your fervor like my master's be placed in contempt farewell fair cruelty 

'what is your parentage above my fortunes yet my state is well i am a gentleman i'll be sworn thou art thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit do give thee five fold blazon not too fast soft soft unless the master were the man how now even so quickly may one catch the plague methinks i feel this youth's perfections with an invisible and subtle stealth to creep in at mine eyes well let it be what ho malvolio re enter malvolio

scene i the sea coast 

enter antonio and sebastian

will you stay no longer nor will you not that i go with you 

by your patience no my stars shine darkly over me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours therefore i shall crave of you your leave that i may bear my evils alone it were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you antonio let me yet know of you whither you are bound 

no sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself you must know of me then antonio my name is sebastian which i called roderigo my father was that sebastian of messaline whom i know you have heard of he left behind him myself and a sister both born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased would we had so ended but you sir altered that for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned 

alas the day 

a lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful but though i could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that yet thus far i will boldly publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair she is drowned already sir with salt water though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more 

pardon me sir your bad entertainment 

o good antonio forgive me your trouble 

if you will not murder me for my love let me be your servant 

if you will not undo what you have done that is kill him whom you have recovered desire it not fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness and i am yet so near the manners of my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me i am bound to the count orsino's court farewell 

the gentleness of all the gods go with thee i have many enemies in orsino's court else would i very shortly see thee there but come what may i do adore thee so that danger shall seem sport and i will go

she took the ring of me i'll none of it

sweet sir toby be patient for tonight since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady she is much out of quiet for monsieur malvolio let me alone with him if i do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation do not think i have wit enough to lie straight in my bed i know i can do it 

possess us possess us tell us something of him 

marry sir sometimes he is a kind of puritan 

o if i thought that i'ld beat him like a dog 

what for being a puritan thy exquisite reason dear knight 

i have no exquisite reason for't but i have reason good enough 

the devil a puritan that he is or any thing constantly but a time pleaser an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths the best persuaded of himself so crammed as he thinks with excellencies that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work 

what wilt thou do 

i will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find himself most feelingly personated i can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands 

excellent i smell a device 

i have't in my nose too 

he shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop that they come from my niece and that she's in love with him 

my purpose is indeed a horse of that colour 

and your horse now would make him an ass 

ass i doubt not 

o twill be admirable 

sport royal i warrant you i know my physic will work with him i will plant you two and let the fool make a third where he shall find the letter observe his construction of it for this night to bed and dream on the event farewell 

good night penthesilea 

before me she's a good wench 

she's a beagle true bred and one that adores me what o that 

i was adored once too 

let's to bed knight thou hadst need send for more money 

if i cannot recover your niece i am a foul way out 

send for money knight if thou hast her not i the end call me cut 

if i do not never trust me take it how you will 

come come i'll go burn some sack tis too late to go to bed now come knight come knight 

scene iv duke orsino's palace 

enter duke orsino viola curio and others

give me some music now good morrow friends now good cesario but that piece of song that old and antique song we heard last night methought it did relieve my passion much more than light airs and recollected terms of these most brisk and giddy paced times come but one verse 

he is not here so please your lordship that should sing it 

who was it 

feste the jester my lord a fool that the lady olivia's father took much delight in he is about the house 

seek him out and play the tune the while exit curio music plays come hither boy if ever thou shalt love in the sweet pangs of it remember me for such as i am all true lovers are unstaid and skittish in all motions else save in the constant image of the creature that is beloved how dost thou like this tune 

it gives a very echo to the seat where love is throned 

thou dost speak masterly my life upon't young though thou art thine eye hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves hath it not boy 

a little by your favour 

what kind of woman is't 

of your complexion 

she is not worth thee then what years i faith 

about your years my lord 

too old by heaven let still the woman take an elder than herself so wears she to him so sways she level in her husband's heart for boy however we do praise ourselves our fancies are more giddy and unfirm more longing wavering sooner lost and worn than women's are 

i think it well my lord 

then let thy love be younger than thyself or thy affection cannot hold the bent for women are as roses whose fair flower being once display'd doth fall that very hour 

and so they are alas that they are so to die even when they to perfection grow re enter curio and clown

o fellow come the song we had last night mark it cesario it is old and plain the spinsters and the knitters in the sun and the free maids that weave their thread with bones do use to chant it it is silly sooth and dallies with the innocence of love like the old age 

clown

are you ready sir 

ay prithee sing music song 

clown

come away come away death and in sad cypress let me be laid fly away fly away breath i am slain by a fair cruel maid my shroud of white stuck all with yew o prepare it my part of death no one so true did share it not a flower not a flower sweet on my black coffin let there be strown not a friend not a friend greet my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown a thousand thousand sighs to save lay me o where sad true lover never find my grave to weep there 

there's for thy pains 

clown

no pains sir i take pleasure in singing sir 

i'll pay thy pleasure then 

clown

truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another 

give me now leave to leave thee 

clown

now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal i would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business might be every thing and their intent every where for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing farewell 

let all the rest give place curio and attendants retire once more cesario get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty tell her my love more noble than the world prizes not quantity of dirty lands the parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her tell her i hold as giddily as fortune but tis that miracle and queen of gems that nature pranks her in attracts my soul 

but if she cannot love you sir 

i cannot be so answer'd 

sooth but you must say that some lady as perhaps there is hath for your love a great a pang of heart as you have for olivia you cannot love her you tell her so must she not then be answer'd 

there is no woman's sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart no woman's heart so big to hold so much they lack retention alas their love may be call'd appetite no motion of the liver but the palate that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt but mine is all as hungry as the sea and can digest as much make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe olivia 

ay but i know 

what dost thou know 

too well what love women to men may owe in faith they are as true of heart as we my father had a daughter loved a man as it might be perhaps were i a woman i should your lordship 

and what's her history 

a blank my lord she never told her love but let concealment like a worm i the bud feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief was not this love indeed we men may say more swear more but indeed our shows are more than will for still we prove much in our vows but little in our love 

but died thy sister of her love my boy 

i am all the daughters of my father's house and all the brothers too and yet i know not sir shall i to this lady 

ay that's the theme to her in haste give her this jewel say my love can give no place bide no denay

fie on him jezebel 

o peace now he's deeply in look how imagination blows him 

having been three months married to her sitting in my state 

o for a stone bow to hit him in the eye 

calling my officers about me in my branched velvet gown having come from a day bed where i have left olivia sleeping 

fire and brimstone 

o peace peace 

and then to have the humour of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them i know my place as i would they should do theirs to for my kinsman toby 

bolts and shackles 

o peace peace peace now now 

seven of my people with an obedient start make out for him i frown the while and perchance wind up watch or play with my some rich jewel toby approaches courtesies there to me 

shall this fellow live 

though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace

what dish o poison has she dressed him 

and with what wing the staniel cheques at it

i will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the sophy

why thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad 

nay but say true does it work upon him 

like aqua vitae with a midwife 

if you will then see the fruits of the sport mark his first approach before my lady he will come to her in yellow stockings and tis a colour she abhors and cross gartered a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt if you will see it follow me 

to the gates of tartar thou most excellent devil of wit 

i'll make one too 

scene i olivia's garden 

enter viola and clown with a tabour

save thee friend and thy music dost thou live by thy tabour 

clown

no sir i live by the church 

art thou a churchman 

clown

no such matter sir i do live by the church for i do live at my house and my house doth stand by the church 

so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabour if thy tabour stand by the church 

clown

you have said sir to see this age a sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward 

nay that's certain they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton 

clown

i would therefore my sister had had no name sir 

why man 

clown

why sir her name's a word and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton but indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them 

thy reason man 

clown

troth sir i can yield you none without words and words are grown so false i am loath to prove reason with them 

i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing 

clown

not so sir i do care for something but in my conscience sir i do not care for you if that be to care for nothing sir i would it would make you invisible 

art not thou the lady olivia's fool 

clown

no indeed sir the lady olivia has no folly she will keep no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings the husband's the bigger i am indeed not her fool but her corrupter of words 

i saw thee late at the count orsino's 

clown

foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun it shines every where i would be sorry sir but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress i think i saw your wisdom there 

nay an thou pass upon me i'll no more with thee hold there's expenses for thee 

clown

now jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard 

by my troth i'll tell thee i am almost sick for one aside though i would not have it grow on my chin is thy lady within 

clown

would not a pair of these have bred sir 

yes being kept together and put to use 

clown

i would play lord pandarus of phrygia sir to bring a cressida to this troilus 

i understand you sir tis well begged 

clown

the matter i hope is not great sir begging but a beggar cressida was a beggar my lady is within sir i will construe to them whence you come who you are and what you would are out of my welkin i might say element but the word is over worn 

this fellow is wise enough to play the fool and to do that well craves a kind of wit he must observe their mood on whom he jests the quality of persons and the time and like the haggard cheque at every feather that comes before his eye this is a practise as full of labour as a wise man's art for folly that he wisely shows is fit but wise men folly fall'n quite taint their wit enter sir toby belch and sir andrew

and he is yours and his must needs be yours your servant's servant is your servant madam 

for him i think not on him for his thoughts would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me 

madam i come to whet your gentle thoughts on his behalf 

o by your leave i pray you i bade you never speak again of him but would you undertake another suit i had rather hear you to solicit that than music from the spheres 

dear lady 

give me leave beseech you i did send after the last enchantment you did here a ring in chase of you so did i abuse myself my servant and i fear me you under your hard construction must i sit to force that on you in a shameful cunning which you knew none of yours what might you think have you not set mine honour at the stake and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts that tyrannous heart can think to one of your receiving enough is shown a cypress not a bosom hideth my heart so let me hear you speak 

i pity you 

that's a degree to love 

no not a grize for tis a vulgar proof that very oft we pity enemies 

why then methinks tis time to smile again o world how apt the poor are to be proud if one should be a prey how much the better to fall before the lion than the wolf clock strikes the clock upbraids me with the waste of time be not afraid good youth i will not have you and yet when wit and youth is come to harvest your were is alike to reap a proper man there lies your way due west 

then westward ho grace and good disposition attend your ladyship you'll nothing madam to my lord by me 

stay i prithee tell me what thou thinkest of me 

that you do think you are not what you are

then think you right i am not what i am 

i would you were as i would have you be 

would it be better madam than i am i wish it might for now i am your fool 

o what a deal of scorn looks beautiful in the contempt and anger of his lip a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon than love that would seem hid love's night is noon cesario by the roses of the spring by maidhood honour truth and every thing i love thee so that maugre all thy pride nor wit nor reason can my passion hide do not extort thy reasons from this clause for that i woo thou therefore hast no cause but rather reason thus with reason fetter love sought is good but given unsought better 

by innocence i swear and by my youth i have one heart one bosom and one truth and that no woman has nor never none shall mistress be of it save i alone and so adieu good madam never more will i my master's tears to you deplore 

yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move that heart which now abhors to like his love 

scene ii olivia's house 

enter sir toby belch sir andrew and fabian

no faith i'll not stay a jot longer 

thy reason dear venom give thy reason 

you must needs yield your reason sir andrew 

marry i saw your niece do more favours to the count's serving man than ever she bestowed upon me i saw't i the orchard 

did she see thee the while old boy tell me that 

as plain as i see you now 

this was a great argument of love in her toward you 

'slight will you make an ass o me 

i will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reason 

and they have been grand jury men since before noah was a sailor 

she did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver you should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests fire new from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness this was looked for at your hand and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my lady's opinion where you will hang like an icicle on a dutchman's beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy 

an't be any way it must be with valour for policy i hate i had as lief be a brownist as a politician 

why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour challenge me the count's youth to fight with him hurt him in eleven places my niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no love broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valour 

there is no way but this sir andrew 

will either of you bear me a challenge to him 

go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and fun of invention taunt him with the licence of ink if thou thou'st him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the bed of ware in england set em down go about it let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou write with a goose pen no matter about it 

where shall i find you 

we'll call thee at the cubiculo go exit sir andrew

this is a dear manikin to you sir toby 

i have been dear to him lad some two thousand strong or so 

we shall have a rare letter from him but you'll not deliver't 

never trust me then and by all means stir on the youth to an answer i think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together for andrew if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea i'll eat the rest of the anatomy 

and his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty enter maria

scene iii a street 

enter sebastian and antonio

i would not by my will have troubled you but since you make your pleasure of your pains i will no further chide you 

i could not stay behind you my desire more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth and not all love to see you though so much as might have drawn one to a longer voyage but jealousy what might befall your travel being skilless in these parts which to a stranger unguided and unfriended often prove rough and unhospitable my willing love the rather by these arguments of fear set forth in your pursuit 

my kind antonio i can no other answer make but thanks and thanks and ever oft good turns are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay but were my worth as is my conscience firm you should find better dealing what's to do shall we go see the reliques of this town 

to morrow sir best first go see your lodging 

i am not weary and tis long to night i pray you let us satisfy our eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that do renown this city 

would you'ld pardon me i do not without danger walk these streets once in a sea fight gainst the count his galleys i did some service of such note indeed that were i ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd 

belike you slew great number of his people 

the offence is not of such a bloody nature albeit the quality of the time and quarrel might well have given us bloody argument it might have since been answer'd in repaying what we took from them which for traffic's sake most of our city did only myself stood out for which if i be lapsed in this place i shall pay dear 

do not then walk too open 

it doth not fit me hold sir here's my purse in the south suburbs at the elephant is best to lodge i will bespeak our diet whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge with viewing of the town there shall you have me

good and valiant 

 reads wonder not nor admire not in thy mind why i do call thee so for i will show thee no reason for't 

a good note that keeps you from the blow of the law 

 reads thou comest to the lady olivia and in my sight she uses thee kindly but thou liest in thy throat that is not the matter i challenge thee for 

very brief and to exceeding good sense less 

 reads i will waylay thee going home where if it be thy chance to kill me

 reads thou killest me like a rogue and a villain 

still you keep o the windy side of the law good 

 reads fare thee well and god have mercy upon one of our souls he may have mercy upon mine but my hope is better and so look to thyself thy friend as thou usest him and thy sworn enemy andrew aguecheek if this letter move him not his legs cannot i'll give't him 

you may have very fit occasion for't he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart 

go sir andrew scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum baily so soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou drawest swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him away 

nay let me alone for swearing 

now will not i deliver his letter for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpole but sir i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon aguecheek a notable report of valour and drive the gentleman as i know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices re enter olivia with viola

here he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave and presently after him 

i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge exeunt sir toby belch fabian and maria

i have said too much unto a heart of stone and laid mine honour too unchary out there's something in me that reproves my fault but such a headstrong potent fault it is that it but mocks reproof 

with the same havior that your passion bears goes on my master's grief 

here wear this jewel for me tis my picture refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you and i beseech you come again to morrow what shall you ask of me that i'll deny that honour saved may upon asking give 

nothing but this your true love for my master 

how with mine honour may i give him that which i have given to you 

i will acquit you 

well come again to morrow fare thee well a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell re enter sir toby belch and fabian

you mistake sir i am sure no man hath any quarrel to me my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man 

you'll find it otherwise i assure you therefore if you hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal 

i pray you sir what is he 

he is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre hob nob is his word give't or take't 

i will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady i am no fighter i have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour belike this is a man of that quirk 

sir no his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury therefore get you on and give him his desire back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must that's certain or forswear to wear iron about you 

this is as uncivil as strange i beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is it is something of my negligence nothing of my purpose 

i will do so signior fabian stay you by this gentleman till my return 

pray you sir do you know of this matter 

i know the knight is incensed against you even to a mortal arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more 

i beseech you what manner of man is he 

nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by his form as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour he is indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of illyria will you walk towards him i will make your peace with him if i can 

i shall be much bound to you for't i am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight i care not who knows so much of my mettle re enter sir toby belch with sir andrew

pox on't i'll not meddle with him 

ay but he will not now be pacified fabian can scarce hold him yonder 

plague on't an i thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence i'ld have seen him damned ere i'ld have challenged him let him let the matter slip and i'll give him my horse grey capilet

lady you have pray you peruse that letter you must not now deny it is your hand write from it if you can in hand or phrase or say tis not your seal nor your invention you can say none of this well grant it then and tell me in the modesty of honour why you have given me such clear lights of favour bade me come smiling and cross garter'd to you to put on yellow stockings and to frown upon sir toby and the lighter people and acting this in an obedient hope why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd kept in a dark house visited by the priest and made the most notorious geck and gull that e'er invention play'd on tell me why 

alas malvolio this is not my writing though i confess much like the character but out of question tis maria's hand and now i do bethink me it was she first told me thou wast mad then camest in smiling and in such forms which here were presupposed upon thee in the letter prithee be content this practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee but when we know the grounds and authors of it thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge of thine own cause 

good madam hear me speak and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come taint the condition of this present hour which i have wonder'd at in hope it shall not most freely i confess myself and toby set this device against malvolio here upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts we had conceived against him maria writ the letter at sir toby's great importance in recompense whereof he hath married her how with a sportful malice it was follow'd may rather pluck on laughter than revenge if that the injuries be justly weigh'd that have on both sides pass'd 

alas poor fool how have they baffled thee
