much ado about nothing

scene i before leonato's house 

enter leonato hero and beatrice with a messenger

i learn in this letter that don peter of arragon comes this night to messina 

messenger

he is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him 

how many gentlemen have you lost in this action 

messenger

but few of any sort and none of name 

a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers i find here that don peter hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio 

messenger

much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how 

he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it 

messenger

i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness 

did he break out into tears 

messenger

in great measure 

a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping 

i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no 

messenger

i know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sort 

what is he that you ask for niece 

my cousin means signior benedick of padua 

messenger

o he's returned and as pleasant as ever he was 

he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the bird bolt i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing 

faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but he'll be meet with you i doubt it not 

messenger

he hath done good service lady in these wars 

you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach 

messenger

and a good soldier too lady 

and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord 

messenger

a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues 

it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing well we are all mortal 

you must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them 

alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother 

messenger

is't possible 

very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block 

messenger

i see lady the gentleman is not in your books 

no an he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil 

messenger

he is most in the company of the right noble claudio 

o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured 

messenger

i will hold friends with you lady 

do good friend 

you will never run mad niece 

no not till a hot january 

messenger

don pedro is approached enter don pedro don john claudio benedick and balthasar

good signior leonato you are come to meet your trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it 

never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave 

you embrace your charge too willingly i think this is your daughter 

her mother hath many times told me so 

were you in doubt sir that you asked her 

signior benedick no for then were you a child 

you have it full benedick we may guess by this what you are being a man truly the lady fathers herself be happy lady for you are like an honourable father 

if signior leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina as like him as she is 

i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick nobody marks you 

what my dear lady disdain are you yet living 

is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence 

then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart for truly i love none 

a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me 

god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face 

scratching could not make it worse an twere such a face as yours were 

well you are a rare parrot teacher 

a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours 

i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer but keep your way i god's name i have done 

you always end with a jade's trick i know you of old 

that is the sum of all leonato signior claudio and signior benedick my dear friend leonato hath invited you all i tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer i dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart 

if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn to don john let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother i owe you all duty 

i thank you i am not of many words but i thank you 

please it your grace lead on 

your hand leonato we will go together exeunt all except benedick and claudio

benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato 

i noted her not but i looked on her 

is she not a modest young lady 

do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex 

no i pray thee speak in sober judgment 

why i faith methinks she's too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation i can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i do not like her 

thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her 

would you buy her that you inquire after her 

can the world buy such a jewel 

yea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a good hare finder and vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song 

in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on 

i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such matter there's her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december but i hope you have no intent to turn husband have you 

i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the contrary if hero would be my wife 

is't come to this in faith hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion shall i never see a bachelor of three score again go to i faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away sundays look don pedro is returned to seek you re enter don pedro

what secret hath held you here that you followed not to leonato's 

i would your grace would constrain me to tell 

i charge thee on thy allegiance 

you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man i would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love with who now that is your grace's part mark how short his answer is with hero leonato's short daughter 

if this were so so were it uttered 

like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be so 

if my passion change not shortly god forbid it should be otherwise 

amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy 

you speak this to fetch me in my lord 

by my troth i speak my thought 

and in faith my lord i spoke mine 

and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine 

that i love her i feel 

that she is worthy i know 

that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake 

thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty 

and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will 

that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which i may go the finer i will live a bachelor 

i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love 

with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad maker's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind cupid 

well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument 

if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called adam 

well as time shall try in time the savage bull doth bear the yoke 

the savage bull may but if ever the sensible benedick bear it pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign here you may see benedick the married man 

if this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn mad 

nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in venice thou wilt quake for this shortly 

i look for an earthquake too then 

well you temporize with the hours in the meantime good signior benedick repair to leonato's commend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation 

i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so i commit you 

to the tuition of god from my house if i had it 

the sixth of july your loving friend benedick 

nay mock not mock not the body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so i leave you 

my liege your highness now may do me good 

my love is thine to teach teach it but how and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good 

hath leonato any son my lord 

no child but hero she's his only heir dost thou affect her claudio 

o my lord when you went onward on this ended action i look'd upon her with a soldier's eye that liked but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love but now i am return'd and that war thoughts have left their places vacant in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires all prompting me how fair young hero is saying i liked her ere i went to wars 

thou wilt be like a lover presently and tire the hearer with a book of words if thou dost love fair hero cherish it and i will break with her and with her father and thou shalt have her was't not to this end that thou began'st to twist so fine a story 

how sweetly you do minister to love that know love's grief by his complexion but lest my liking might too sudden seem i would have salved it with a longer treatise 

what need the bridge much broader than the flood the fairest grant is the necessity look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovest and i will fit thee with the remedy i know we shall have revelling to night i will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair hero i am claudio and in her bosom i'll unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale then after to her father will i break and the conclusion is she shall be thine in practise let us put it presently 

scene ii a room in leonato's house 

enter leonato and antonio meeting

how now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this music 

he is very busy about it but brother i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of 

are they good 

as the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward the prince and count claudio walking in a thick pleached alley in mine orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it 

hath the fellow any wit that told you this 

a good sharp fellow i will send for him and question him yourself 

no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true go you and tell her of it enter attendants cousins you know what you have to do o i cry you mercy friend go you with me and i will use your skill good cousin have a care this busy time 

scene iii the same 

enter don john and conrade

what the good year my lord why are you thus out of measure sad 

there is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit 

you should hear reason 

and when i have heard it what blessing brings it 

if not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance 

i wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art born under saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief i cannot hide what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile at no man's jests eat when i have stomach and wait for no man's leisure sleep when i am drowsy and tend on no man's business laugh when i am merry and claw no man in his humour 

yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment you have of late stood out against your brother and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest 

i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though i cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but i am a plain dealing villain i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek not to alter me 

can you make no use of your discontent 

i make all use of it for i use it only who comes here enter borachio what news borachio 

i came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by leonato and i can give you intelligence of an intended marriage 

will it serve for any model to build mischief on what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness 

marry it is your brother's right hand 

who the most exquisite claudio 

even he 

a proper squire and who and who which way looks he 

marry on hero the daughter and heir of leonato 

a very forward march chick how came you to this 

being entertained for a perfumer as i was smoking a musty room comes me the prince and claudio hand in hand in sad conference i whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo hero for himself and having obtained her give her to count claudio 

come come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure that young start up hath all the glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist me 

to the death my lord 

let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that i am subdued would the cook were of my mind shall we go prove what's to be done 

we'll wait upon your lordship 

scene i a hall in leonato's house 

enter leonato antonio hero beatrice and others

was not count john here at supper 

i saw him not 

how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heart burned an hour after 

he is of a very melancholy disposition 

he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling 

then half signior benedick's tongue in count john's mouth and half count john's melancholy in signior benedick's face 

with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a could get her good will 

by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue 

in faith she's too curst 

too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god's sending that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none 

so by being too curst god will send you no horns 

just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen 

you may light on a husband that hath no beard 

what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear ward and lead his apes into hell 

well then go you into hell 

no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven here's no place for you maids so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long 

 to hero well niece i trust you will be ruled by your father 

yes faith it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy and say father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say father as it please me 

well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband 

not till god make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle i'll none adam's sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred 

daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer 

the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave 

cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly 

i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight 

the revellers are entering brother make good room all put on their masks enter don pedro claudio benedick balthasar don john borachio margaret ursula and others masked

lady will you walk about with your friend 

so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away 

with me in your company 

i may say so when i please 

and when please you to say so 

when i like your favour for god defend the lute should be like the case 

my visor is philemon's roof within the house is jove 

why then your visor should be thatched 

speak low if you speak love drawing her aside

well i would you did like me 

so would not i for your own sake for i have many ill qualities 

which is one 

i say my prayers aloud 

i love you the better the hearers may cry amen 

god match me with a good dancer 

amen 

and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is done answer clerk 

no more words the clerk is answered 

i know you well enough you are signior antonio 

at a word i am not 

i know you by the waggling of your head 

to tell you true i counterfeit him 

you could never do him so ill well unless you were the very man here's his dry hand up and down you are he you are he 

at a word i am not 

come come do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit can virtue hide itself go to mum you are he graces will appear and there's an end 

will you not tell me who told you so 

no you shall pardon me 

nor will you not tell me who you are 

not now 

that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry tales well this was signior benedick that said so 

what's he 

i am sure you know him well enough 

not i believe me 

did he never make you laugh 

i pray you what is he 

why he is the prince's jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me 

when i know the gentleman i'll tell him what you say 

do do he'll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there's a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night music we must follow the leaders 

in every good thing 

nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning dance then exeunt all except don john borachio and claudio

sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it the ladies follow her and but one visor remains 

and that is claudio i know him by his bearing 

are not you signior benedick 

you know me well i am he 

signior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on hero i pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it 

how know you he loves her 

i heard him swear his affection 

so did i too and he swore he would marry her to night 

come let us to the banquet exeunt don john and borachio

thus answer i in the name of benedick but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio tis certain so the prince wooes for himself friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood this is an accident of hourly proof which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero re enter benedick

count claudio 

yea the same 

come will you go with me 

whither 

even to the next willow about your own business county what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurer's chain or under your arm like a lieutenant's scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero 

i wish him joy of her 

why that's spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus 

i pray you leave me 

ho now you strike like the blind man twas the boy that stole your meat and you'll beat the post 

if it will not be i'll leave you 

alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the prince's fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well i'll be revenged as i may re enter don pedro

now signior where's the count did you see him 

troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped 

to be whipped what's his fault 

the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his companion and he steals it 

wilt thou make a trust a transgression the transgression is in the stealer 

yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his birds nest 

i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner 

if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly 

the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you 

o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the prince's jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam bad left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her 

look here she comes enter claudio beatrice hero and leonato

will your grace command me any service to the world's end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a tooth picker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester john's foot fetch you a hair off the great cham's beard do you any embassage to the pigmies rather than hold three words conference with this harpy you have no employment for me 

none but to desire your good company 

o god sir here's a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue 

come lady come you have lost the heart of signior benedick 

indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it 

you have put him down lady you have put him down 

so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek 

why how now count wherefore are you sad 

not sad my lord 

how then sick 

neither my lord 

the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion 

i faith lady i think your blazon to be true though i'll be sworn if he be so his conceit is false here claudio i have wooed in thy name and fair hero is won i have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and god give thee joy 

count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and an grace say amen to it 

speak count tis your cue 

silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little happy if i could say how much lady as you are mine i am yours i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange 

speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither 

in faith lady you have a merry heart 

yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart 

and so she doth cousin 

good lord for alliance thus goes every one to the world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry heigh ho for a husband 

lady beatrice i will get you one 

i would rather have one of your father's getting hath your grace ne'er a brother like you your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them 

will you have me lady 

no my lord unless i might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter 

your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour 

no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born cousins god give you joy 

niece will you look to those things i told you of 

i cry you mercy uncle by your grace's pardon 

by my troth a pleasant spirited lady 

there's little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing 

she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband 

o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit 

she were an excellent wife for benedict 

o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad 

county claudio when mean you to go to church 

to morrow my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites 

not till monday my dear son which is hence a just seven night and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind 

come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of hercules labours which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction 

my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings 

and i my lord 

and you too gentle hero 

i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband 

and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty i will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick and i with your two helps will so practise on benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer hi s glory shall be ours for we are the only love gods go in with me and i will tell you my drift 

scene ii the same 

enter don john and borachio

it is so the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato 

yea my lord but i can cross it 

any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriage 

not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me 

show me briefly how 

i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero 

i remember 

i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window 

what life is in that to be the death of this marriage 

the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as hero 

what proof shall i make of that 

proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue 

only to despite them i will endeavour any thing 

go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio as in love of your brother's honour who hath made this match and his friend's reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid that you have discovered thus they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown 

grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in practise be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats 

be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me

scene iii leonato's orchard 

enter benedick

boy enter boy

boy

signior 

in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard 

boy

i am here already sir 

i know that but i would have thee hence and here again exit boy i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile a foot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i'll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be that's certain wise or i'll none virtuous or i'll never cheapen her fair or i'll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in the arbour withdraws enter don pedro claudio and leonato

come shall we hear this music 

yea my good lord how still the evening is as hush'd on purpose to grace harmony 

see you where benedick hath hid himself 

o very well my lord the music ended we'll fit the kid fox with a pennyworth enter balthasar with music

come balthasar we'll hear that song again 

o good my lord tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once 

it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection i pray thee sing and let me woo no more 

because you talk of wooing i will sing since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes yet will he swear he loves 

now pray thee come or if thou wilt hold longer argument do it in notes 

note this before my notes there's not a note of mine that's worth the noting 

why these are very crotchets that he speaks note notes forsooth and nothing air

now divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of men's bodies well a horn for my money when all's done the song

sigh no more ladies sigh no more men were deceivers ever one foot in sea and one on shore to one thing constant never then sigh not so but let them go and be you blithe and bonny converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny sing no more ditties sing no moe of dumps so dull and heavy the fraud of men was ever so since summer first was leafy then sigh not so and c 

by my troth a good song 

and an ill singer my lord 

ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift 

an he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the night raven come what plague could have come after it 

yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee get us some excellent music for to morrow night we would have it at the lady hero's chamber window 

the best i can my lord 

do so farewell exit balthasar come hither leonato what was it you told me of to day that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick 

o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did never think that lady would have loved any man 

no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor 

is't possible sits the wind in that corner 

by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought 

may be she doth but counterfeit 

faith like enough 

o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it 

why what effects of passion shows she 

bait the hook well this fish will bite 

what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how 

she did indeed 

how how pray you you amaze me i would have i thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection 

i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick 

i should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide himself in such reverence 

he hath ta'en the infection hold it up 

hath she made her affection known to benedick 

no and swears she never will that's her torment 

'tis true indeed so your daughter says shall i says she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that i love him 

this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she'll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all 

now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of 

o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet 

that 

o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should 

then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o sweet benedick god give me patience 

she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true 

it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it 

to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse 

an he should it were an alms to hang him she's an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous 

and she is exceeding wise 

in every thing but in loving benedick 

o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian 

i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what a will say 

were it good think you 

hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness 

she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible he'll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit 

he is a very proper man 

he hath indeed a good outward happiness 

before god and in my mind very wise 

he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit 

and i take him to be valiant 

as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christian like fear 

if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling 

and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love 

never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel 

nay that's impossible she may wear her heart out first 

well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady 

my lord will you walk dinner is ready 

if he do not dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation 

let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage and no such matter that's the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show let us send her to call him in to dinner exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato

 coming forward this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married here comes beatrice by this day she's a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her enter beatrice

against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner 

fair beatrice i thank you for your pains 

i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come 

you take pleasure then in the message 

yea just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well 

ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner there's a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me that's as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture 

scene i leonato's garden 

enter hero margaret and ursula

good margaret run thee to the parlor there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheard'st us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripen'd by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our purpose this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone 

i'll make her come i warrant you presently 

now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupid's crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay enter beatrice behind now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference 

the pleasant'st angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture fear you not my part of the dialogue 

then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it approaching the bower no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggerds of the rock 

but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely 

so says the prince and my new trothed lord 

and did they bid you tell her of it madam 

they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they loved benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it 

why did you so doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon 

o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framed a woman's heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self endeared 

sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest she make sport at it 

why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featured but she would spell him backward if fair faced she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antique made a foul blot if tall a lance ill headed if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth 

sure sure such carping is not commendable 

no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like cover'd fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling 

yet tell her of it hear what she will say 

no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly i'll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking 

o do not do your cousin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true judgment having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to have as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick 

he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio 

i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy 

indeed he hath an excellent good name 

his excellence did earn it ere he had it when are you married madam 

why every day to morrow come go in i'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me to morrow 

she's limed i warrant you we have caught her madam 

if it proves so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps exeunt hero and ursula

 coming forward what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemn'd for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly 

scene ii a room in leonato's house

enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato

i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward arragon 

i'll bring you thither my lord if you'll vouchsafe me 

nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid's bow string and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks 

gallants i am not as i have been 

so say i methinks you are sadder 

i hope he be in love 

hang him truant there's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love if he be sad he wants money 

i have the toothache 

draw it 

hang it 

you must hang it first and draw it afterwards 

what sigh for the toothache 

where is but a humour or a worm 

well every one can master a grief but he that has it 

yet say i he is in love 

there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a frenchman to morrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is 

if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat o mornings what should that bode 

hath any man seen him at the barber's 

no but the barber's man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls 

indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard 

nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that 

that's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love 

the greatest note of it is his melancholy 

and when was he wont to wash his face 

yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say of him 

nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops 

indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude conclude he is in love 

nay but i know who loves him 

that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not 

yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him 

she shall be buried with her face upwards 

yet is this no charm for the toothache old signior walk aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobby horses must not hear exeunt benedick and leonato

for my life to break with him about beatrice 

'tis even so hero and margaret have by this played their parts with beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet enter don john

my lord and brother god save you 

good den brother 

if your leisure served i would speak with you 

in private 

if it please you yet count claudio may hear for what i would speak of concerns him 

what's the matter 

 to claudio means your lordship to be married to morrow 

you know he does 

i know not that when he knows what i know 

if there be any impediment i pray you discover it 

you may think i love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that i now will manifest for my brother i think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed 

why what's the matter 

i came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened for she has been too long a talking of the lady is disloyal 

who hero 

even she leonato's hero your hero every man's hero 

disloyal 

the word is too good to paint out her wickedness i could say she were worse think you of a worse title and i will fit her to it wonder not till further warrant go but with me to night you shall see her chamber window entered even the night before her wedding day if you love her then to morrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind 

may this be so 

i will not think it 

if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know if you will follow me i will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly 

if i see any thing to night why i should not marry her to morrow in the congregation where i should wed there will i shame her 

and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join with thee to disgrace her 

i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself 

o day untowardly turned 

o mischief strangely thwarting 

o plague right well prevented so will you say when you have seen the sequel 

scene iii a street 

enter dogberry and verges with the watch

are you good men and true 

yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul 

nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the prince's watch 

well give them their charge neighbour dogberry 

first who think you the most desertless man to be constable 

first watchman

hugh otecake sir or george seacole for they can write and read 

come hither neighbour seacole god hath blessed you with a good name to be a well favoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature 

second watchman

both which master constable 

you have i knew it would be your answer well for your favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the prince's name 

second watchman

how if a will not stand 

why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave 

if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the prince's subjects 

true and they are to meddle with none but the prince's subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured 

watchman

we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch 

why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen well you are to call at all the ale houses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed 

watchman

how if they will not 

why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for 

watchman

well sir 

if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty 

watchman

if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him 

truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company 

you have been always called a merciful man partner 

truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him 

if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it 

watchman

how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us 

why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats 

'tis very true 

this is the end of the charge you constable are to present the prince's own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay him 

nay by'r our lady that i think a cannot 

five shillings to one on't with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will 

by'r lady i think it be so 

ha ha ha well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows counsels and your own and good night come neighbour 

watchman

well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the church bench till two and then all to bed 

one word more honest neighbours i pray you watch about signior leonato's door for the wedding being there to morrow there is a great coil to night adieu be vigitant i beseech you exeunt dogberry and verges enter borachio and conrade

what conrade 

watchman

 aside peace stir not 

conrade i say 

here man i am at thy elbow 

mass and my elbow itched i thought there would a scab follow 

i will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy tale 

stand thee close then under this pent house for it drizzles rain and i will like a true drunkard utter all to thee 

watchman

 aside some treason masters yet stand close 

therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats 

is it possible that any villany should be so dear 

thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will 

i wonder at it 

that shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man 

yes it is apparel 

i mean the fashion 

yes the fashion is the fashion 

tush i may as well say the fool's the fool but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is 

watchman

 aside i know that deformed a has been a vile thief this seven year a goes up and down like a gentleman i remember his name 

didst thou not hear somebody 

no twas the vane on the house 

seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily a turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five and thirty sometimes fashioning them like pharaoh's soldiers in the reeky painting sometime like god bel's priests in the old church window sometime like the shaven hercules in the smirched worm eaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club 

all this i see and i see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man but art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion 

not so neither but know that i have to night wooed margaret the lady hero's gentlewoman by the name of hero she leans me out at her mistress chamber window bids me a thousand times good night i tell this tale vilely i should first tell thee how the prince claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master don john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter 

and thought they margaret was hero 

two of them did the prince and claudio but the devil my master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander that don john had made away went claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw o'er night and send her home again without a husband 

first watchman

we charge you in the prince's name stand 

second watchman

call up the right master constable we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth 

first watchman

and one deformed is one of them i know him a wears a lock 

masters masters 

second watchman

you'll be made bring deformed forth i warrant you 

masters 

first watchman

never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us 

we are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of these men's bills 

a commodity in question i warrant you come we'll obey you 

scene iv hero's apartment

god give me joy to wear it for my heart is exceeding heavy 

'twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man 

fie upon thee art not ashamed 

of what lady of speaking honourably is not marriage honourable in a beggar is not your lord honourable without marriage i think you would have me say saving your reverence a husband and bad thinking do not wrest true speaking i'll offend nobody is there any harm in the heavier for a husband none i think and it be the right husband and the right wife otherwise tis light and not heavy ask my lady beatrice else here she comes enter beatrice

what pace is this that thy tongue keeps 

not a false gallop re enter ursula

scene i a church 

enter don pedro don john leonato friar francis claudio benedick hero beatrice and attendants

come friar francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards 

you come hither my lord to marry this lady 

no 

to be married to her friar you come to marry her 

lady you come hither to be married to this count 

i do 

if either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined charge you on your souls to utter it 

know you any hero 

none my lord 

know you any count 

i dare make his answer none 

o what men dare do what men may do what men daily do not knowing what they do 

how now interjections why then some be of laughing as ah ha he 

stand thee by friar father by your leave will you with free and unconstrained soul give me this maid your daughter 

as freely son as god did give her me 

and what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift 

nothing unless you render her again 

sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness there leonato take her back again give not this rotten orange to your friend she's but the sign and semblance of her honour behold how like a maid she blushes here o what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue would you not swear all you that see her that she were a maid by these exterior shows but she is none she knows the heat of a luxurious bed her blush is guiltiness not modesty 

what do you mean my lord 

not to be married not to knit my soul to an approved wanton 

dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity 

i know what you would say if i have known her you will say she did embrace me as a husband and so extenuate the forehand sin no leonato i never tempted her with word too large but as a brother to his sister show'd bashful sincerity and comely love 

and seem'd i ever otherwise to you 

out on thee seeming i will write against it you seem to me as dian in her orb as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown but you are more intemperate in your blood than venus or those pamper'd animals that rage in savage sensuality 

is my lord well that he doth speak so wide 

sweet prince why speak not you 

what should i speak i stand dishonour'd that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale 

are these things spoken or do i but dream 

sir they are spoken and these things are true 

this looks not like a nuptial 

true o god 

leonato stand i here is this the prince is this the prince's brother is this face hero's are our eyes our own 

all this is so but what of this my lord 

let me but move one question to your daughter and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her bid her answer truly 

i charge thee do so as thou art my child 

o god defend me how am i beset what kind of catechising call you this 

to make you answer truly to your name 

is it not hero who can blot that name with any just reproach 

marry that can hero hero itself can blot out hero's virtue what man was he talk'd with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one now if you are a maid answer to this 

i talk'd with no man at that hour my lord 

why then are you no maiden leonato i am sorry you must hear upon mine honour myself my brother and this grieved count did see her hear her at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed most like a liberal villain confess'd the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret 

fie fie they are not to be named my lord not to be spoke of there is not chastity enough in language without offence to utter them thus pretty lady i am sorry for thy much misgovernment 

o hero what a hero hadst thou been if half thy outward graces had been placed about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell thou pure impiety and impious purity for thee i'll lock up all the gates of love and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm and never shall it more be gracious 

hath no man's dagger here a point for me hero swoons

why how now cousin wherefore sink you down 

come let us go these things come thus to light smother her spirits up exeunt don pedro don john and claudio

how doth the lady 

dead i think help uncle hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar 

o fate take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wish'd for 

how now cousin hero 

have comfort lady 

dost thou look up 

yea wherefore should she not 

wherefore why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal nature's frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar's issue at my gates who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of her why she o she is fallen into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh 

sir sir be patient for my part i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say 

o on my soul my cousin is belied 

lady were you her bedfellow last night 

no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow 

confirm'd confirm'd o that is stronger made which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who loved her so that speaking of her foulness wash'd it with tears hence from her let her die 

hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune by noting of the lady i have mark'd a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes and in her eye there hath appear'd a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observations which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenor of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error 

friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness 

lady what man is he you are accused of 

they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintain'd the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death 

there is some strange misprision in the princes 

two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practise of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villanies 

i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awaked in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly 

pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your family's old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial 

what shall become of this what will this do 

marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must so be maintain'd upon the instant that she was accused shall be lamented pitied and excused of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparell'd in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levell'd false the supposition of the lady's death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries 

signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body 

being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me 

'tis well consented presently away for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure come lady die to live this wedding day perhaps is but prolong'd have patience and endure exeunt all but benedick and beatrice

lady beatrice have you wept all this while 

yea and i will weep a while longer 

i will not desire that 

you have no reason i do it freely 

surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged 

ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her 

is there any way to show such friendship 

a very even way but no such friend 

may a man do it 

it is a man's office but not yours 

i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange 

as strange as the thing i know not it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin 

by my sword beatrice thou lovest me 

do not swear and eat it 

i will swear by it that you love me and i will make him eat it that says i love not you 

will you not eat your word 

with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest i love thee 

why then god forgive me 

what offence sweet beatrice 

you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you 

and do it with all thy heart 

i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest 

come bid me do any thing for thee 

kill claudio 

ha not for the wide world 

you kill me to deny it farewell 

tarry sweet beatrice 

i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go 

beatrice 

in faith i will go 

we'll be friends first 

you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy 

is claudio thine enemy 

is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the market place 

hear me beatrice 

talk with a man out at a window a proper saying 

nay but beatrice 

sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone 

beat 

princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into courtesies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving 

tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee 

use it for my love some other way than swearing by it 

think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero 

yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul 

enough i am engaged i will challenge him i will kiss your hand and so i leave you by this hand claudio shall render me a dear account as you hear of me so think of me go comfort your cousin i must say she is dead and so farewell 

scene ii a prison 

enter dogberry verges and sexton in gowns and the watch with conrade and borachio

o a stool and a cushion for the sexton 

sexton

i am a gentleman sir and my name is conrade 

write down master gentleman conrade masters do you serve god 

borachio

yea sir we hope 

write down that they hope they serve god and write god first for god defend but god should go before such villains masters it is proved already that you are little better than false knaves and it will go near to be thought so shortly how answer you for yourselves 

marry sir we say we are none 

a marvellous witty fellow i assure you but i will go about with him come you hither sirrah a word in your ear sir i say to you it is thought you are false knaves 

sir i say to you we are none 

well stand aside fore god they are both in a tale have you writ down that they are none 

sexton

master constable you go not the way to examine you must call forth the watch that are their accusers 

yea marry that's the eftest way let the watch come forth masters i charge you in the prince's name accuse these men 

first watchman

this man said sir that don john the prince's brother was a villain 

write down prince john a villain why this is flat perjury to call a prince's brother villain 

master constable 

pray thee fellow peace i do not like thy look i promise thee 

sexton

what heard you him say else 

second watchman

marry that he had received a thousand ducats of don john for accusing the lady hero wrongfully 

flat burglary as ever was committed 

yea by mass that it is 

sexton

what else fellow 

first watchman

and that count claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace hero before the whole assembly and not marry her 

o villain thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this 

sexton

what else 

watchman

this is all 

sexton

and this is more masters than you can deny prince john is this morning secretly stolen away hero was in this manner accused in this very manner refused and upon the grief of this suddenly died master constable let these men be bound and brought to leonato's i will go before and show him their examination 

come let them be opinioned 

let them be in the hands 

off coxcomb 

god's my life where's the sexton let him write down the prince's officer coxcomb come bind them thou naughty varlet 

away you are an ass you are an ass 

dost thou not suspect my place dost thou not suspect my years o that he were here to write me down an ass but masters remember that i am an ass though it be not written down yet forget not that i am an ass no thou villain thou art full of piety as shall be proved upon thee by good witness i am a wise fellow and which is more an officer and which is more a householder and which is more as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in messina and one that knows the law go to and a rich fellow enough go to and a fellow that hath had losses and one that hath two gowns and every thing handsome about him bring him away o that i had been writ down an ass 

scene i before leonato's house 

enter leonato and antonio

if you go on thus you will kill yourself and tis not wisdom thus to second grief against yourself 

i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine and bid him speak of patience measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain as thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candle wasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial medicine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words no no tis all men's office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no man's virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement 

therein do men from children nothing differ 

i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance 

yet bend not all the harm upon yourself make those that do offend you suffer too 

there thou speak'st reason nay i will do so my soul doth tell me hero is belied and that shall claudio know so shall the prince and all of them that thus dishonour her 

here comes the prince and claudio hastily enter don pedro and claudio

good den good den 

good day to both of you 

hear you my lords 

we have some haste leonato 

some haste my lord well fare you well my lord are you so hasty now well all is one 

nay do not quarrel with us good old man 

if he could right himself with quarreling some of us would lie low 

who wrongs him 

marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword i fear thee not 

marry beshrew my hand if it should give your age such cause of fear in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword 

tush tush man never fleer and jest at me i speak not like a dotard nor a fool as under privilege of age to brag what i have done being young or what would do were i not old know claudio to thy head thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me that i am forced to lay my reverence by and with grey hairs and bruise of many days do challenge thee to trial of a man i say thou hast belied mine innocent child thy slander hath gone through and through her heart and she lies buried with her ancestors o in a tomb where never scandal slept save this of hers framed by thy villany 

my villany 

thine claudio thine i say 

you say not right old man 

my lord my lord i'll prove it on his body if he dare despite his nice fence and his active practise his may of youth and bloom of lustihood 

away i will not have to do with you 

canst thou so daff me thou hast kill'd my child if thou kill'st me boy thou shalt kill a man 

he shall kill two of us and men indeed but that's no matter let him kill one first win me and wear me let him answer me come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me sir boy i'll whip you from your foining fence nay as i am a gentleman i will 

brother 

content yourself god knows i loved my niece and she is dead slander'd to death by villains that dare as well answer a man indeed as i dare take a serpent by the tongue boys apes braggarts jacks milksops 

brother antony 

hold you content what man i know them yea and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple scrambling out facing fashion monging boys that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander go anticly show outward hideousness and speak off half a dozen dangerous words how they might hurt their enemies if they durst and this is all 

but brother antony 

come tis no matter do not you meddle let me deal in this 

gentlemen both we will not wake your patience my heart is sorry for your daughter's death but on my honour she was charged with nothing but what was true and very full of proof 

my lord my lord 

i will not hear you 

no come brother away i will be heard 

and shall or some of us will smart for it exeunt leonato and antonio

see see here comes the man we went to seek enter benedick

now signior what news 

good day my lord 

welcome signior you are almost come to part almost a fray 

we had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth 

leonato and his brother what thinkest thou had we fought i doubt we should have been too young for them 

in a false quarrel there is no true valour i came to seek you both 

we have been up and down to seek thee for we are high proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away wilt thou use thy wit 

it is in my scabbard shall i draw it 

dost thou wear thy wit by thy side 

never any did so though very many have been beside their wit i will bid thee draw as we do the minstrels draw to pleasure us 

as i am an honest man he looks pale art thou sick or angry 

what courage man what though care killed a cat thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care 

sir i shall meet your wit in the career and you charge it against me i pray you choose another subject 

nay then give him another staff this last was broke cross 

by this light he changes more and more i think he be angry indeed 

if he be he knows how to turn his girdle 

shall i speak a word in your ear 

god bless me from a challenge 

 aside to claudio you are a villain i jest not i will make it good how you dare with what you dare and when you dare do me right or i will protest your cowardice you have killed a sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you let me hear from you 

well i will meet you so i may have good cheer 

what a feast a feast 

i faith i thank him he hath bid me to a calf's head and a capon the which if i do not carve most curiously say my knife's naught shall i not find a woodcock too 

sir your wit ambles well it goes easily 

i'll tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the other day i said thou hadst a fine wit true said she a fine little one no said i a great wit right says she a great gross one nay said i a good wit just said she it hurts nobody nay said i the gentleman is wise certain said she a wise gentleman nay said i he hath the tongues that i believe said she for he swore a thing to me on monday night which he forswore on tuesday morning there's a double tongue there's two tongues thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou wast the properest man in italy 

for the which she wept heartily and said she cared not 

yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly the old man's daughter told us all 

all all and moreover god saw him when he was hid in the garden 

but when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible benedick's head 

yea and text underneath here dwells benedick the married man 

fare you well boy you know my mind i will leave you now to your gossip like humour you break jests as braggarts do their blades which god be thanked hurt not my lord for your many courtesies i thank you i must discontinue your company your brother the bastard is fled from messina you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady for my lord lackbeard there he and i shall meet and till then peace be with him 

he is in earnest 

in most profound earnest and i'll warrant you for the love of beatrice 

and hath challenged thee 

most sincerely 

what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit 

he is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man 

but soft you let me be pluck up my heart and be sad did he not say my brother was fled enter dogberry verges and the watch with conrade and borachio

come you sir if justice cannot tame you she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance nay an you be a cursing hypocrite once you must be looked to 

how now two of my brother's men bound borachio one 

hearken after their offence my lord 

officers what offence have these men done 

marry sir they have committed false report moreover they have spoken untruths secondarily they are slanders sixth and lastly they have belied a lady thirdly they have verified unjust things and to conclude they are lying knaves 

first i ask thee what they have done thirdly i ask thee what's their offence sixth and lastly why they are committed and to conclude what you lay to their charge 

rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth there's one meaning well suited 

who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to your answer this learned constable is too cunning to be understood what's your offence 

sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer do you hear me and let this count kill me i have deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how don john your brother incensed me to slander the lady hero how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero's garments how you disgraced her when you should marry her my villany they have upon record which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame the lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation and briefly i desire nothing but the reward of a villain 

runs not this speech like iron through your blood 

i have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it 

but did my brother set thee on to this 

yea and paid me richly for the practise of it 

he is composed and framed of treachery and fled he is upon this villany 

sweet hero now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that i loved it first 

come bring away the plaintiffs by this time our sexton hath reformed signior leonato of the matter and masters do not forget to specify when time and place shall serve that i am an ass 

here here comes master signior leonato and the sexton too re enter leonato and antonio with the sexton

which is the villain let me see his eyes that when i note another man like him i may avoid him which of these is he 

if you would know your wronger look on me 

art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd mine innocent child 

yea even i alone 

no not so villain thou beliest thyself here stand a pair of honourable men a third is fled that had a hand in it i thank you princes for my daughter's death record it with your high and worthy deeds twas bravely done if you bethink you of it 

i know not how to pray your patience yet i must speak choose your revenge yourself impose me to what penance your invention can lay upon my sin yet sinn'd i not but in mistaking 

by my soul nor i and yet to satisfy this good old man i would bend under any heavy weight that he'll enjoin me to 

i cannot bid you bid my daughter live that were impossible but i pray you both possess the people in messina here how innocent she died and if your love can labour ought in sad invention hang her an epitaph upon her tomb and sing it to her bones sing it to night to morrow morning come you to my house and since you could not be my son in law be yet my nephew my brother hath a daughter almost the copy of my child that's dead and she alone is heir to both of us give her the right you should have given her cousin and so dies my revenge 

o noble sir your over kindness doth wring tears from me i do embrace your offer and dispose for henceforth of poor claudio 

to morrow then i will expect your coming to night i take my leave this naughty man shall face to face be brought to margaret who i believe was pack'd in all this wrong hired to it by your brother 

no by my soul she was not nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me but always hath been just and virtuous in any thing that i do know by her 

moreover sir which indeed is not under white and black this plaintiff here the offender did call me ass i beseech you let it be remembered in his punishment and also the watch heard them talk of one deformed they say be wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and borrows money in god's name the which he hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hard hearted and will lend nothing for god's sake pray you examine him upon that point 

i thank thee for thy care and honest pains 

your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth and i praise god for you 

there's for thy pains 

god save the foundation 

go i discharge thee of thy prisoner and i thank thee 

i leave an arrant knave with your worship which i beseech your worship to correct yourself for the example of others god keep your worship i wish your worship well god restore you to health i humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry meeting may be wished god prohibit it come neighbour exeunt dogberry and verges

until to morrow morning lords farewell 

farewell my lords we look for you to morrow 

we will not fail 

to night i'll mourn with hero 

 to the watch bring you these fellows on we'll talk with margaret how her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow exeunt severally

scene ii leonato's garden 

enter benedick and margaret meeting

pray thee sweet mistress margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice 

will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty 

in so high a style margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it 

to have no man come over me why shall i always keep below stairs 

thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth it catches 

and yours as blunt as the fencer's foils which hit but hurt not 

a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a woman and so i pray thee call beatrice i give thee the bucklers 

give us the swords we have bucklers of our own 

if you use them margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids 

well i will call beatrice to you who i think hath legs 

and therefore will come exit margaret sings the god of love that sits above and knows me and knows me how pitiful i deserve i mean in singing but in loving leander the good swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and a whole bookful of these quondam carpet mangers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love marry i cannot show it in rhyme i have tried i can find out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet nor i cannot woo in festival terms enter beatrice sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee 

yea signior and depart when you bid me 

o stay but till then 

'then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio 

only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee 

foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed 

thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit but i must tell thee plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe him a coward and i pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me 

for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me 

suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love indeed for i love thee against my will 

in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates 

thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably 

it appears not in this confession there's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself 

an old an old instance beatrice that lived in the lime of good neighbours if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps 

and how long is that think you 

question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore is it most expedient for the wise if don worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as i am to myself so much for praising myself who i myself will bear witness is praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin 

very ill 

and how do you 

very ill too 

serve god love me and mend there will i leave you too for here comes one in haste enter ursula

madam you must come to your uncle yonder's old coil at home it is proved my lady hero hath been falsely accused the prince and claudio mightily abused and don john is the author of all who is fed and gone will you come presently

scene iv a room in leonato's house 

enter leonato antonio benedick beatrice margaret ursula friar francis and hero

did i not tell you she was innocent 

so are the prince and claudio who accused her upon the error that you heard debated but margaret was in some fault for this although against her will as it appears in the true course of all the question 

well i am glad that all things sort so well 

and so am i being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it 

well daughter and you gentle women all withdraw into a chamber by yourselves and when i send for you come hither mask'd exeunt ladies the prince and claudio promised by this hour to visit me you know your office brother you must be father to your brother's daughter and give her to young claudio 

which i will do with confirm'd countenance 

friar i must entreat your pains i think 

to do what signior 

to bind me or undo me one of them signior leonato truth it is good signior your niece regards me with an eye of favour 

that eye my daughter lent her tis most true 

and i do with an eye of love requite her 

the sight whereof i think you had from me from claudio and the prince but what's your will 

your answer sir is enigmatical but for my will my will is your good will may stand with ours this day to be conjoin'd in the state of honourable marriage in which good friar i shall desire your help 

my heart is with your liking 

and my help here comes the prince and claudio enter don pedro and claudio and two or three others

good morrow to this fair assembly 

good morrow prince good morrow claudio we here attend you are you yet determined to day to marry with my brother's daughter 

i'll hold my mind were she an ethiope 

call her forth brother here's the friar ready exit antonio

good morrow benedick why what's the matter that you have such a february face so full of frost of storm and cloudiness 

i think he thinks upon the savage bull tush fear not man we'll tip thy horns with gold and all europa shall rejoice at thee as once europa did at lusty jove when he would play the noble beast in love 

bull jove sir had an amiable low and some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow and got a calf in that same noble feat much like to you for you have just his bleat 

for this i owe you here comes other reckonings re enter antonio with the ladies masked which is the lady i must seize upon 

this same is she and i do give you her 

why then she's mine sweet let me see your face 

no that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her 

give me your hand before this holy friar i am your husband if you like of me 

and when i lived i was your other wife unmasking and when you loved you were my other husband 

another hero 

nothing certainer one hero died defiled but i do live and surely as i live i am a maid 

the former hero hero that is dead 

she died my lord but whiles her slander lived 

all this amazement can i qualify when after that the holy rites are ended i'll tell you largely of fair hero's death meantime let wonder seem familiar and to the chapel let us presently 

soft and fair friar which is beatrice 

 unmasking i answer to that name what is your will 

do not you love me 

why no no more than reason 

why then your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived they swore you did 

do not you love me 

troth no no more than reason 

why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived for they did swear you did 

they swore that you were almost sick for me 

they swore that you were well nigh dead for me 

'tis no such matter then you do not love me 

no truly but in friendly recompense 

come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman 

and i'll be sworn upon't that he loves her for here's a paper written in his hand a halting sonnet of his own pure brain fashion'd to beatrice 

and here's another writ in my cousin's hand stolen from her pocket containing her affection unto benedick 

a miracle here's our own hands against our hearts come i will have thee but by this light i take thee for pity 

i would not deny you but by this good day i yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for i was told you were in a consumption 

peace i will stop your mouth kissing her

how dost thou benedick the married man 

i'll tell thee what prince a college of wit crackers cannot flout me out of my humour dost thou think i care for a satire or an epigram no if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear nothing handsome about him in brief since i do purpose to marry i will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what i have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion for thy part claudio i did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin 

i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice that i might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life to make thee a double dealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to thee 

come come we are friends let's have a dance ere we are married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives heels 

we'll have dancing afterward 

first of my word therefore play music prince thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn enter a messenger

messenger

my lord your brother john is ta'en in flight and brought with armed men back to messina 

think not on him till to morrow i'll devise thee brave punishments for him strike up pipers dance
