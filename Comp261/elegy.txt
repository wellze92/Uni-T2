the love i bore to your brother and will do to his memory hath craved from me this last duty of a friend i am herein but a second to the privilege of truth who can warrant more in his behalf than i undertook to deliver exercise in this kind i will little affect and am less addicted to but there must be miracle in that labor which to witness my remembrance to this departed gentleman i would not willingly undergo yet whatsoever is here done is done to him and to him only for whom and whose sake i will not forget to remember any friendly respects to you or to any of those that have loved him for himself and himself for his deserts

a funeral elegy 

since time and his predestinated end abridged the circuit of his hopeful days whiles both his youth and virtue did intend the good endeavors of deserving praise what memorable monument can last whereon to build his never blemished name but his own worth wherein his life was graced sith as that ever he maintained the same oblivion in the darkest day to come when sin shall tread on merit in the dust cannot rase out the lamentable tomb of his short lived deserts but still they must even in the hearts and memories of men claim fit respect that they in every limb remembering what he was with comfort then may pattern out one truly good by him for he was truly good if honest care of harmless conversation may commend a life free from such stains as follies are ill recompensed only in his end nor can the tongue of him who loved him least if there can be minority of love to one superlative above the rest of many men in steady faith reprove his constant temper in the equal weight of thankfulness and kindness truth doth leave sufficient proof he was in every right as kind to give as thankful to receive the curious eye of a quick brained survey could scantly find a mote amidst the sun of his too shortened days or make a prey of any faulty errors he had done not that he was above the spleenful sense and spite of malice but for that he had warrant enough in his own innocence against the sting of some in nature bad yet who is he so absolutely blest that lives encompassed in a mortal frame sometime in reputation not oppressed by some in nothing famous but defame such in the bypath and the ridgeway lurk that leads to ruin in a smooth pretense of what they do to be a special work of singleness not tending to offense whose very virtues are not to detract whiles hope remains of gain base fee of slaves despising chiefly men in fortunes wracked but death to such gives unremembered graves now therein lived he happy if to be free from detraction happiness it be his younger years gave comfortable hope to hope for comfort in his riper youth which harvest like did yield again the crop of education bettered in his truth those noble twins of heaven infused races learning and wit refined in their kind did jointly both in their peculiar graces enrich the curious temple of his mind indeed a temple in whose precious white sat reason by religion overswayed teaching his other senses with delight how piety and zeal should be obeyed not fruitlessly in prodigal expense wasting his best of time but so content with reason's golden mean to make defense against the assault of youth's encouragement as not the tide of this surrounding age when now his father's death had freed his will could make him subject to the drunken rage of such whose only glory is their ill he from the happy knowledge of the wise draws virtue to reprove secured fools and shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice to spend his spring of days in sacred schools here gave he diet to the sick desires that day by day assault the weaker man and with fit moderation still retires from what doth batter virtue now and then but that i not intend in full discourse to progress out his life i could display a good man in each part exact and force the common voice to warrant what i say for if his fate and heaven had decreed that full of days he might have lived to see the grave in peace the times that should succeed had been best speaking witnesses with me whose conversation so untouched did move respect most in itself as who would scan his honesty and worth by them might prove he was a kind true perfect gentleman not in the outside of disgraceful folly courting opinion with unfit disguise affecting fashions nor addicted wholly to unbeseeming blushless vanities but suiting so his habit and desire as that his virtue was his best attire not in the waste of many idle words cared he to be heard talk nor in the float of fond conceit such as this age affords by vain discourse upon himself to dote for his becoming silence gave such grace to his judicious parts as what he spake seemed rather answers which the wise embrace than busy questions such as talkers make and though his qualities might well deserve just commendation yet his furnished mind such harmony of goodness did preserve as nature never built in better kind knowing the best and therefore not presuming in knowing but for that it was the best ever within himself free choice resuming of true perfection in a perfect breast so that his mind and body made an inn the one to lodge the other both like framed for fair conditions guests that soonest win applause in generality well famed if trim behavior gestures mild discreet endeavors modest speech beseeming mirth true friendship active grace persuasion sweet delightful love innated from his birth acquaintance unfamiliar carriage just offenseless resolution wished sobriety clean tempered moderation steady trust unburthened conscience unfeigned piety if these or all of these knit fast in one can merit praise then justly may we say not any from this frailer stage is gone whose name is like to live a longer day though not in eminent courts or places great for popular concourse yet in that soil where he enjoyed his birth life death and seat which now sits mourning his untimely spoil and as much glory is it to be good for private persons in their private home as those descended from illustrious blood in public view of greatness whence they come though i rewarded with some sadder taste of knowing shame by feeling it have proved my country's thankless misconstruction cast upon my name and credit both unloved by some whose fortunes sunk into the wane of plenty and desert have strove to win justice by wrong and sifted to embane my reputation with a witless sin yet time the father of unblushing truth may one day lay ope malice which hath crossed it and right the hopes of my endangered youth purchasing credit in the place i lost it even in which place the subject of the verse unhappy matter of a mourning style which now that subject's merits doth rehearse had education and new being while by fair demeanor he had won repute amongst the all of all that lived there for that his actions did so wholly suit with worthiness still memorable here the many hours till the day of doom will not consume his life and hapless end for should he lie obscured without a tomb time would to time his honesty commend whiles parents to their children will make known and they to their posterity impart how such a man was sadly overthrown by a hand guided by a cruel heart whereof as many as shall hear that sadness will blame the one's hard fate the other's madness whiles such as do recount that tale of woe told by remembrance of the wisest heads will in the end conclude the matter so as they will all go weeping to their beds for when the world lies wintered in the storms of fearful consummation and lays down th unsteady change of his fantastic forms expecting ever to be overthrown when the proud height of much affected sin shall ripen to a head and in that pride end in the miseries it did begin and fall amidst the glory of his tide then in a book where every work is writ shall this man's actions be revealed to show the gainful fruit of well employed wit which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe here shall be reckoned up the constant faith never untrue where once he love professed which is a miracle in men one saith long sought though rarely found and he is best who can make friendship in those times of change admired more for being firm than strange when those weak houses of our brittle flesh shall ruined be by death our grace and strength youth memory and shape that made us fresh cast down and utterly decayed at length when all shall turn to dust from whence we came and we low leveled in a narrow grave what can we leave behind us but a name which by a life well led may honor have such honor o thou youth untimely lost thou didst deserve and hast for though thy soul hath took her flight to a diviner coast yet here on earth thy fame lives ever whole in every heart sealed up in every tongue fit matter to discourse no day prevented that pities not thy sad and sudden wrong of all alike beloved and lamented and i here to thy memorable worth in this last act of friendship sacrifice my love to thee which i could not set forth in any other habit of disguise although i could not learn whiles yet thou wert to speak the language of a servile breath my truth stole from my tongue into my heart which shall not thence be sundered but in death and i confess my love was too remiss that had not made thee know how much i prized thee but that mine error was as yet it is to think love best in silence for i sized thee by what i would have been not only ready in telling i was thine but being so by some effect to show it he is steady who seems less than he is in open show since then i still reserved to try the worst which hardest fate and time thus can lay on me t enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first while thou hadst life i took this task upon me to register with mine unhappy pen such duties as it owes to thy desert and set thee as a president to men and limn thee to the world but as thou wert not hired as heaven can witness in my soul by vain conceit to please such ones as know it nor servile to be liked free from control which pain to many men i do not owe it but here i trust i have discharged now fair lovely branch too soon cut off to thee my constant and irrefragable vow as had it chanced thou mightst have done to me but that no merit strong enough of mine had yielded store to thy well abled quill whereby t enroll my name as this of thine how s'ere enriched by thy plenteous skill here then i offer up to memory the value of my talent precious man whereby if thou live to posterity though t be not as i would tis as i can in minds from whence endeavor doth proceed a ready will is taken for the deed yet ere i take my longest last farewell from thee fair mark of sorrow let me frame some ampler work of thank wherein to tell what more thou didst deserve than in thy name and free thee from the scandal of such senses as in the rancor of unhappy spleen measure thy course of life with false pretenses comparing by thy death what thou hast been so in his mischiefs is the world accursed it picks out matter to inform the worst the willful blindness that hoodwinks the eyes of men enwrapped in an earthy veil makes them most ignorantly exercise and yield to humor when it doth assail whereby the candle and the body's light darkens the inward eyesight of the mind presuming still it sees even in the night of that same ignorance which makes them blind hence conster they with corrupt commentaries proceeding from a nature as corrupt the text of malice which so often varies as tis by seeming reason underpropped o whither tends the lamentable spite of this world's teenful apprehension which understands all things amiss whose light shines not amidst the dark of their dissension true tis this man whiles yet he was a man soothed not the current of besotted fashion nor could disgest as some loose mimics can an empty sound of overweening passion so much to be made servant to the base and sensual aptness of disunioned vices to purchase commendation by disgrace whereto the world and heat of sin entices but in a safer contemplation secure in what he knew he ever chose the ready way to commendation by shunning all invitements strange of those whose illness is the necessary praise must wait upon their actions only rare in being rare in shame which strives to raise their name by doing what they do not care as if the free commission of their ill were even as boundless as their prompt desires only like lords like subjects to their will which their fond dotage ever more admires he was not so but in a serious awe ruling the little ordered commonwealth of his own self with honor to the law that gave peace to his bread bread to his health which ever he maintained in sweet content and pleasurable rest wherein he joyed a monarchy of comfort's government never until his last to be destroyed for in the vineyard of heaven favored learning where he was double honored in degree his observation and discreet discerning had taught him in both fortunes to be free whence now retired home to a home indeed the home of his condition and estate he well provided gainst the hand of need whence young men sometime grow unfortunate his disposition by the bonds of unity so fastened to his reason that it strove with understanding's grave immunity to purchase from all hearts a steady love wherein not any one thing comprehends proportionable note of what he was than that he was so constant to his friends as he would no occasion overpass which might make known his unaffected care in all respects of trial to unlock his bosom and his store which did declare that christ was his and he was friendship's rock a rock of friendship figured in his name foreshowing what he was and what should be most true presage and he discharged the same in every act of perfect amity though in the complemental phrase of words he never was addicted to the vain of boast such as the common breath affords he was in use most fast in tongue most plain nor amongst all those virtues that forever adorned his reputation will be found one greater than his faith which did persever where once it was protested alway sound hence sprung the deadly fuel that revived the rage which wrought his end for had he been slacker in love he had been longer lived and not oppressed by wrath's unhappy sin by wrath's unhappy sin which unadvised gave death for free good will and wounds for love pity it was that blood had not been prized at higher rate and reason set above most unjust choler which untimely drew destruction on itself and most unjust robbed virtue of a follower so true as time can boast of both for love and trust so henceforth all great glory to his blood shall be but seconds to him being good the wicked end their honor with their sin in death which only then the good begin lo here a lesson by experience taught for men whose pure simplicity hath drawn their trust to be betrayed by being caught within the snares of making truth a pawn whiles it not doubting whereinto it enters without true proof and knowledge of a friend sincere in singleness of heart adventers to give fit cause ere love begin to end his unfeigned friendship where it least was sought him to a fatal timeless ruin brought whereby the life that purity adorned with real merit by this sudden end is in the mouth of some in manner scorned made questionable for they do intend according to the tenor of the saw mistook if not observed writ long ago when men were only led by reason's law that such as is the end the life proves so thus he who to the universal lapse gave sweet redemption offering up his blood to conquer death by death and loose the traps of hell even in the triumph that it stood he thus for that his guiltless life was spilt by death which was made subject to the curse might in like manner be reproved of guilt in his pure life for that his end was worse but o far be it our unholy lips should so profane the deity above as thereby to ordain revenging whips against the day of judgment and of love the hand that lends us honor in our days may shorten when it please and justly take our honor from us many sundry ways as best becomes that wisdom did us make the second brother who was next begot of all that ever were begotten yet was by a hand in vengeance rude and hot sent innocent to be in heaven set whose fame the angels in melodious choirs still witness to the world then why should he well profited in excellent desires be more rebuked who had like destiny those saints before the everlasting throne who sit with crowns of glory on their heads washed white in blood from earth hence have not gone all to their joys in quiet on their beds but tasted of the sour bitter scourge of torture and affliction ere they gained those blessings which their sufferance did urge whereby the grace fore promised they attained let then the false suggestions of the froward building large castles in the empty air by suppositions fond and thoughts untoward issues of discontent and sick despair rebound gross arguments upon their heart that may disprove their malice and confound uncivil loose opinions which insert their souls into the roll that doth unsound betraying policies and show their brains unto their shame ridiculous whose scope is envy whose endeavors fruitless pains in nothing surely prosperous but hope and that same hope so lame so unprevailing it buries self conceit in weak opinion which being crossed gives matter of bewailing their vain designs on whom want hath dominion such and of such condition may devise which way to wound with defamation's spirit close lurking whisper's hidden forgeries his taintless goodness his desertful merit but whiles the minds of men can judge sincerely upon assured knowledge his repute and estimation shall be rumored clearly in equal worth time shall to time renew t the grave that in his ever empty womb forever closes up the unrespected who when they die die all shall not entomb his pleading best perfections as neglected they to his notice in succeeding years shall speak for him when he shall lie below when nothing but his memory appears of what he was then shall his virtues grow his being but a private man in rank and yet not ranked beneath a gentleman shall not abridge the commendable thank which wise posterity shall give him then for nature and his therein happy fate ordained that by his quality of mind t ennoble that best part although his state were to a lower blessedness confined blood pomp state honor glory and command without fit ornaments of disposition are in themselves but heathenish and profaned and much more peaceful is a mean condition which underneath the roof of safe content feeds on the bread of rest and takes delight to look upon the labors it hath spent for its own sustenance both day and night whiles others plotting which way to be great how to augment their portion and ambition do toil their giddy brains and ever sweat for popular applause and power's commission but one in honors like a seeled dove whose inward eyes are dimmed with dignity does think most safety doth remain above and seeks to be secure by mounting high whence when he falls who did erewhile aspire falls deeper down for that he climbed higher now men who in lower region live exempt from danger of authority have fittest times in reason's rules to thrive not vexed with envy of priority and those are much more noble in the mind than many that have nobleness by kind birth blood and ancestors are none of ours nor can we make a proper challenge to them but virtues and perfections in our powers proceed most truly from us if we do them respective titles or a gracious style with all what men in eminence possess are without ornaments to praise them vile the beauty of the mind is nobleness 
and such as have that beauty well deserve eternal characters that after death remembrance of their worth we may preserve so that their glory die not with their breath else what avails it in a goodly strife upon this face of earth here to contend the good t exceed the wicked in their life should both be like obscured in their end until which end there is none rightly can be termed happy since the happiness depends upon the goodness of the man which afterwards his praises will express look hither then you that enjoy the youth of your best days and see how unexpected death can betray your jollity to ruth when death you think is least to be respected the person of this model here set out had all that youth and happy days could give him yet could not all encompass him about against th assault of death who to relieve him strook home but to the frail and mortal parts of his humanity but could not touch his flourishing and fair long lived deserts above fate's reach his singleness was such so that he dies but once but doubly lives once in his proper self then in his name predestinated time who all deprives could never yet deprive him of the same and had the genius which attended on him been possibilited to keep him safe against the rigor that hath overgone him he had been to the public use a staff leading by his example in the path which guides to doing well wherein so few the proneness of this age to error hath informed rightly in the courses true as then the loss of one whose inclination stove to win love in general is sad so specially his friends in soft compassion do feel the greatest loss they could have had amongst them all she who those nine of years lived fellow to his counsels and his bed hath the most share in loss for i in hers feel what distemperature this chance hath bred the chaste embracements of conjugal love who in a mutual harmony consent are so impatient of a strange remove as meager death itself seems to lament and weep upon those cheeks which nature framed to be delightful orbs in whom the force of lively sweetness plays so that ashamed death often pities his unkind divorce such was the separation here constrained well worthy to be termed a rudeness rather for in his life his love was so unfeigned as he was both an husband and a father the one in firm affection and the other in careful providence which ever strove with joint assistance to grace one another with every helpful furtherance of love but since the sum of all that can be said can be but said that he was good which wholly includes all excellence can be displayed in praise of virtue and reproach of folly his due deserts this sentence on him gives he died in life yet in his death he lives now runs the method of this doleful song in accents brief to thee o thou deceased to whom those pains do only all belong as witnesses i did not love thee least for could my worthless brain find out but how to raise thee from the sepulcher of dust undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now of life with me and heaven be counted just if to a supplicating soul it would give life anew by giving life again where life is missed whereby discomfort should right his old griefs and former joys retain which now with thee are leaped into thy tomb and buried in that hollow vault of woe expecting yet a more severer doom than time's strict flinty hand will let em know and now if i have leveled mine account and reckoned up in a true measured score those perfect graces which were ever wont to wait on thee alive i ask no more but shall hereafter in a poor content immure those imputations i sustain learning my days of youth so to prevent as not to be cast down by them again only those hopes which fate denies to grant in full possession to a captive heart who if it were in plenty still would want before it may enjoy his better part from which detained and banished in th exile of dim misfortune has none other prop whereon to lean and rest itself the while but the weak comfort of the hapless hope and hope must in despite of fearful change play in the strongest closet of my breast although perhaps i ignorantly range and court opinion in my deep'st unrest but whether doth the stream of my mischance drive me beyond myself fast friend soon lost long may thy worthiness thy name advance amongst the virtuous and deserving most who herein hast forever happy proved in life thou lived'st in death thou died'st beloved
