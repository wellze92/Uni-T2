the third part of king henry the sixth

scene i london the parliament house 

alarum enter york edward richard norfolk montague warwick and soldiers

i wonder how the king escaped our hands 

while we pursued the horsemen of the north he slily stole away and left his men whereat the great lord of northumberland whose warlike ears could never brook retreat cheer'd up the drooping army and himself lord clifford and lord stafford all abreast charged our main battle's front and breaking in were by the swords of common soldiers slain 

lord stafford's father duke of buckingham is either slain or wounded dangerously i cleft his beaver with a downright blow that this is true father behold his blood 

and brother here's the earl of wiltshire's blood whom i encounter'd as the battles join'd 

speak thou for me and tell them what i did throwing down somerset's head

richard hath best deserved of all my sons but is your grace dead my lord of somerset 

such hope have all the line of john of gaunt 

thus do i hope to shake king henry's head 

and so do i victorious prince of york before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close this is the palace of the fearful king and this the regal seat possess it york for this is thine and not king henry's heirs'

assist me then sweet warwick and i will for hither we have broken in by force 

we'll all assist you he that flies shall die 

thanks gentle norfolk stay by me my lords and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night they go up

and when the king comes offer no violence unless he seek to thrust you out perforce 

the queen this day here holds her parliament but little thinks we shall be of her council by words or blows here let us win our right 

arm'd as we are let's stay within this house 

the bloody parliament shall this be call'd unless plantagenet duke of york be king and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice hath made us by words to our enemies 

then leave me not my lords be resolute i mean to take possession of my right 

neither the king nor he that loves him best the proudest he that holds up lancaster dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells i'll plant plantagenet root him up who dares resolve thee richard claim the english crown flourish enter king henry vi clifford northumberland westmoreland exeter and the rest

my lords look where the sturdy rebel sits even in the chair of state belike he means back'd by the power of warwick that false peer to aspire unto the crown and reign as king earl of northumberland he slew thy father and thine lord clifford and you both have vow'd revenge on him his sons his favourites and his friends 

if i be not heavens be revenged on me 

the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel 

what shall we suffer this let's pluck him down my heart for anger burns i cannot brook it 

be patient gentle earl of westmoreland 

patience is for poltroons such as he he durst not sit there had your father lived my gracious lord here in the parliament let us assail the family of york 

well hast thou spoken cousin be it so 

ah know you not the city favours them and they have troops of soldiers at their beck 

but when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly 

far be the thought of this from henry's heart to make a shambles of the parliament house cousin of exeter frowns words and threats shall be the war that henry means to use thou factious duke of york descend my throne and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet i am thy sovereign 

i am thine 

for shame come down he made thee duke of york 

'twas my inheritance as the earldom was 

thy father was a traitor to the crown 

exeter thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry 

whom should he follow but his natural king 

true clifford and that's richard duke of york 

and shall i stand and thou sit in my throne 

it must and shall be so content thyself 

be duke of lancaster let him be king 

he is both king and duke of lancaster and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain 

and warwick shall disprove it you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers and with colours spread march'd through the city to the palace gates 

yes warwick i remember it to my grief and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it 

plantagenet of thee and these thy sons thy kinsman and thy friends i'll have more lives than drops of blood were in my father's veins 

urge it no more lest that instead of words i send thee warwick such a messenger as shall revenge his death before i stir 

poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats 

will you we show our title to the crown if not our swords shall plead it in the field 

what title hast thou traitor to the crown thy father was as thou art duke of york thy grandfather roger mortimer earl of march i am the son of henry the fifth who made the dauphin and the french to stoop and seized upon their towns and provinces 

talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all 

the lord protector lost it and not i when i was crown'd i was but nine months old 

you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose father tear the crown from the usurper's head 

sweet father do so set it on your head 

good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus 

sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly 

sons peace 

peace thou and give king henry leave to speak 

plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords and be you silent and attentive too for he that interrupts him shall not live 

think'st thou that i will leave my kingly throne wherein my grandsire and my father sat no first shall war unpeople this my realm ay and their colours often borne in france and now in england to our heart's great sorrow shall be my winding sheet why faint you lords my title's good and better far than his 

prove it henry and thou shalt be king 

henry the fourth by conquest got the crown 

'twas by rebellion against his king 

 aside i know not what to say my title's weak tell me may not a king adopt an heir 

what then 

an if he may then am i lawful king for richard in the view of many lords resign'd the crown to henry the fourth whose heir my father was and i am his 

he rose against him being his sovereign and made him to resign his crown perforce 

suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd think you twere prejudicial to his crown 

no for he could not so resign his crown but that the next heir should succeed and reign 

art thou against us duke of exeter 

his is the right and therefore pardon me 

why whisper you my lords and answer not 

my conscience tells me he is lawful king 

 aside all will revolt from me and turn to him 

plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st think not that henry shall be so deposed 

deposed he shall be in despite of all 

thou art deceived tis not thy southern power of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud can set the duke up in despite of me 

king henry be thy title right or wrong lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence may that ground gape and swallow me alive where i shall kneel to him that slew my father 

o clifford how thy words revive my heart 

henry of lancaster resign thy crown what mutter you or what conspire you lords 

do right unto this princely duke of york or i will fill the house with armed men and over the chair of state where now he sits write up his title with usurping blood he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves

my lord of warwick hear me but one word let me for this my life time reign as king 

confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest 

i am content richard plantagenet enjoy the kingdom after my decease 

what wrong is this unto the prince your son 

what good is this to england and himself 

base fearful and despairing henry 

how hast thou injured both thyself and us 

i cannot stay to hear these articles 

nor i 

come cousin let us tell the queen these news 

farewell faint hearted and degenerate king in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides 

be thou a prey unto the house of york and die in bands for this unmanly deed 

in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome or live in peace abandon'd and despised exeunt northumberland clifford and westmoreland

turn this way henry and regard them not 

they seek revenge and therefore will not yield 

ah exeter 

why should you sigh my lord 

not for myself lord warwick but my son whom i unnaturally shall disinherit but be it as it may i here entail the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever conditionally that here thou take an oath to cease this civil war and whilst i live to honour me as thy king and sovereign and neither by treason nor hostility to seek to put me down and reign thyself 

this oath i willingly take and will perform 

long live king henry plantagenet embrace him 

and long live thou and these thy forward sons 

now york and lancaster are reconciled 

accursed be he that seeks to make them foes sennet here they come down

farewell my gracious lord i'll to my castle 

and i'll keep london with my soldiers 

and i to norfolk with my followers 

and i unto the sea from whence i came exeunt york edward edmund george richard warwick norfolk montague their soldiers and attendants

here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger i'll steal away 

exeter so will i 

nay go not from me i will follow thee 

be patient gentle queen and i will stay 

who can be patient in such extremes ah wretched man would i had died a maid and never seen thee never borne thee son seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus hadst thou but loved him half so well as i or felt that pain which i did for him once or nourish'd him as i did with my blood thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart blood there rather than have that savage duke thine heir and disinherited thine only son 

father you cannot disinherit me if you be king why should not i succeed 

pardon me margaret pardon me sweet son the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me 

enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch thou hast undone thyself thy son and me and given unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance to entail him and his heirs unto the crown what is it but to make thy sepulchre and creep into it far before thy time warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas the duke is made protector of the realm and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds the trembling lamb environed with wolves had i been there which am a silly woman the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes before i would have granted to that act but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself both from thy table henry and thy bed until that act of parliament be repeal'd whereby my son is disinherited the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours will follow mine if once they see them spread and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace and utter ruin of the house of york thus do i leave thee come son let's away our army is ready come we'll after them 

stay gentle margaret and hear me speak 

thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone 

gentle son edward thou wilt stay with me 

ay to be murder'd by his enemies 

when i return with victory from the field i'll see your grace till then i'll follow her 

come son away we may not linger thus exeunt queen margaret and prince edward

poor queen how love to me and to her son hath made her break out into terms of rage revenged may she be on that hateful duke whose haughty spirit winged with desire will cost my crown and like an empty eagle tire on the flesh of me and of my son the loss of those three lords torments my heart i'll write unto them and entreat them fair come cousin you shall be the messenger 

and i i hope shall reconcile them all 

scene ii sandal castle 

enter richard edward and montague

brother though i be youngest give me leave 

no i can better play the orator 

but i have reasons strong and forcible enter york

why how now sons and brother at a strife what is your quarrel how began it first 

no quarrel but a slight contention 

about what 

about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours 

mine boy not till king henry be dead 

your right depends not on his life or death 

now you are heir therefore enjoy it now by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe it will outrun you father in the end 

i took an oath that he should quietly reign 

but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year 

no god forbid your grace should be forsworn 

i shall be if i claim by open war 

i'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak 

thou canst not son it is impossible 

an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous therefore to arms and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy why do we finger thus i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart 

richard enough i will be king or die brother thou shalt to london presently and whet on warwick to this enterprise thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk and tell him privily of our intent you edward shall unto my lord cobham with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise in them i trust for they are soldiers witty courteous liberal full of spirit while you are thus employ'd what resteth more but that i seek occasion how to rise and yet the king not privy to my drift nor any of the house of lancaster enter a messenger but stay what news why comest thou in such post 

messenger

ay with my sword what think'st thou that we fear them edward and richard you shall stay with me my brother montague shall post to london let noble warwick cobham and the rest whom we have left protectors of the king with powerful policy strengthen themselves and trust not simple henry nor his oaths 

brother i go i'll win them fear it not and thus most humbly i do take my leave enter john mortimer and hugh mortimer sir john and sir hugh mortimer mine uncles you are come to sandal in a happy hour the army of the queen mean to besiege us 

she shall not need we'll meet her in the field 

what with five thousand men 

ay with five hundred father for a need a woman's general what should we fear a march afar off

i hear their drums let's set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight 

five men to twenty though the odds be great i doubt not uncle of our victory many a battle have i won in france when as the enemy hath been ten to one why should i not now have the like success alarum exeunt

scene iii field of battle betwixt sandal castle and wakefield 

alarums enter rutland and his tutor

ah whither shall i fly to scape their hands ah tutor look where bloody clifford comes enter clifford and soldiers

chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life as for the brat of this accursed duke whose father slew my father he shall die 

tutor

and i my lord will bear him company 

soldiers away with him 

tutor

ah clifford murder not this innocent child lest thou be hated both of god and man exit dragged off by soldiers

how now is he dead already or is it fear that makes him close his eyes i'll open them 

so looks the pent up lion o'er the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws and so he walks insulting o'er his prey and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword and not with such a cruel threatening look sweet clifford hear me speak before i die i am too mean a subject for thy wrath be thou revenged on men and let me live 

in vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter 

then let my father's blood open it again he is a man and clifford cope with him 

had thy brethren here their lives and thine were not revenge sufficient for me no if i digg'd up thy forefathers graves and hung their rotten coffins up in chains it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart the sight of any of the house of york is as a fury to torment my soul and till i root out their accursed line and leave not one alive i live in hell therefore lifting his hand

o let me pray before i take my death to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me 

such pity as my rapier's point affords 

i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me 

thy father hath 

but twas ere i was born thou hast one son for his sake pity me lest in revenge thereof sith god is just he be as miserably slain as i ah let me live in prison all my days and when i give occasion of offence then let me die for now thou hast no cause 

no cause thy father slew my father therefore die stabs him

di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae dies

plantagenet i come plantagenet and this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both 

scene iv another part of the field 

alarum enter york

the army of the queen hath got the field my uncles both are slain in rescuing me and all my followers to the eager foe turn back and fly like ships before the wind or lambs pursued by hunger starved wolves my sons god knows what hath bechanced them but this i know they have demean'd themselves like men born to renown by life or death three times did richard make a lane to me and thrice cried courage father fight it out and full as oft came edward to my side with purple falchion painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encounter'd him and when the hardiest warriors did retire richard cried charge and give no foot of ground and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre with this we charged again but out alas we bodged again as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with over matching waves a short alarum within ah hark the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury and were i strong i would not shun their fury the sands are number'd that make up my life here must i stay and here my life must end enter queen margaret clifford northumberland prince edward and soldiers come bloody clifford rough northumberland i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt and i abide your shot 

yield to our mercy proud plantagenet 

ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm with downright payment show'd unto my father now phaethon hath tumbled from his car and made an evening at the noontide prick 

my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven scorning whate'er you can afflict me with why come you not what multitudes and fear 

so cowards fight when they can fly no further so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives breathe out invectives gainst the officers 

o clifford but bethink thee once again and in thy thought o'er run my former time and if though canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this 

i will not bandy with thee word for word but buckle with thee blows twice two for one 

hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes i would prolong awhile the traitor's life wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland 

hold clifford do not honour him so much to prick thy finger though to wound his heart what valour were it when a cur doth grin for one to thrust his hand between his teeth when he might spurn him with his foot away it is war's prize to take all vantages and ten to one is no impeach of valour they lay hands on york who struggles

ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin 

so doth the cony struggle in the net 

so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty so true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd 

what would your grace have done unto him now 

brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand what was it you that would be england's king was't you that revell'd in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent where are your mess of sons to back you now the wanton edward and the lusty george and where's that valiant crook back prodigy dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies or with the rest where is your darling rutland look york i stain'd this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapier's point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state i prithee grieve to make me merry york what hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutland's death why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance thou wouldst be fee'd i see to make me sport york cannot speak unless he wear a crown a crown for york and lords bow low to him hold you his hands whilst i do set it on putting a paper crown on his head ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henry's chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantagenet is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henry's glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o tis a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead 

that is my office for my father's sake 

nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes 

she wolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth how ill beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizard like unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide how couldst thou drain the life blood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a woman's face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bids't thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman 

beshrew me but his passion moves me so that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears 

that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless father's tears this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tell'st the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand hard hearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads 

had he been slaughter man to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul 

what weeping ripe my lord northumberland think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears 

here's for my oath here's for my father's death stabbing him

and here's to right our gentle hearted king stabbing him

open thy gate of mercy gracious god my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee dies

off with his head and set it on york gates so york may overlook the town of york flourish exeunt

scene i a plain near mortimer's cross in herefordshire 

a march enter edward richard and their power

i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit had he been ta'en we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad 

i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs who having pinch'd a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love 

dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns 

three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but sever'd in a pale clear shining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vow'd some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one light one sun in this the heaven figures some event 

'tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and over shine the earth as this the world whate'er it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fair shining suns 

nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male enter a messenger but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue 

messenger

ah one that was a woful looker on when as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord 

o speak no more for i have heard too much 

say how he died for i will hear it all 

messenger

environed he was with many foes and stood against them as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enter'd troy but hercules himself must yield to odds and many strokes though with a little axe hew down and fell the hardest timber'd oak by many hands your father was subdued but only slaughter'd by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd 

sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee now my soul's palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy 

i cannot weep for all my body's moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name i'll venge thy death or die renowned by attempting it 

his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left 

nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his march enter warwick montague and their army

how now fair lords what fare what news abroad 

great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each word's deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord the duke of york is slain 

o warwick warwick that plantagenet which held three dearly as his soul's redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death 

ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall'n after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king muster'd my soldiers gather'd flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought march'd toward saint alban's to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry's oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint alban's met our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who look'd full gently on his warlike queen that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of clifford's rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the night owl's lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste post haste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again 

where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england 

some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war 

'twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne'er till now his scandal of retire 

nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer 

i know it well lord warwick blame me not tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time what's to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our ave maries with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords 

why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easy melting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly 

ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay 

lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail'st as god forbid the hour must edward fall which peril heaven forfend 

no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is england's royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'd in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task 

then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds i come to pierce it or to give thee mine 

then strike up drums god and saint george for us enter a messenger

my gracious liege this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside to whom do lions cast their gentle looks not to the beast that would usurp their den whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick not his that spoils her young before her face who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting not he that sets his foot upon her back the smallest worm will turn being trodden on and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood ambitious york doth level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he but a duke would have his son a king and raise his issue like a loving sire thou being a king blest with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father unreasonable creatures feed their young and though man's face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who hath not seen them even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight make war with him that climb'd unto their nest offer their own lives in their young's defence for shame my liege make them your precedent were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his father's fault and long hereafter say unto his child what my great grandfather and his grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away ah what a shame were this look on the boy and let his manly face which promiseth successful fortune steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him 

full well hath clifford play'd the orator inferring arguments of mighty force but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things ill got had ever bad success and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a thousand fold more care to keep than in possession and jot of pleasure ah cousin york would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here 

my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh and this soft courage makes your followers faint you promised knighthood to our forward son unsheathe your sword and dub him presently edward kneel down 

edward plantagenet arise a knight and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right 

my gracious father by your kingly leave i'll draw it as apparent to the crown and in that quarrel use it to the death 

why that is spoken like a toward prince enter a messenger

royal commanders be in readiness for with a band of thirty thousand men comes warwick backing of the duke of york and in the towns as they do march along proclaims him king and many fly to him darraign your battle for they are at hand 

i would your highness would depart the field the queen hath best success when you are absent 

ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune 

why that's my fortune too therefore i'll stay 

be it with resolution then to fight 

my royal father cheer these noble lords and hearten those that fight in your defence unsheathe your sword good father cry saint george march enter edward george richard warwick norfolk montague and soldiers

now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field 

go rate thy minions proud insulting boy becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king 

i am his king and he should bow his knee i was adopted heir by his consent since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caused him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in 

and reason too who should succeed the father but the son 

are you there butcher o i cannot speak 

ay crook back here i stand to answer thee or any he the proudest of thy sort 

'twas you that kill'd young rutland was it not 

ay and old york and yet not satisfied 

for god's sake lords give signal to the fight 

what say'st thou henry wilt thou yield the crown 

why how now long tongued warwick dare you speak when you and i met at saint alban's last your legs did better service than your hands 

then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine 

you said so much before and yet you fled 

'twas not your valour clifford drove me thence 

no nor your manhood that durst make you stay 

northumberland i hold thee reverently break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my big swoln heart upon that clifford that cruel child killer 

i slew thy father call'st thou him a child 

ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed 

have done with words my lords and hear me speak 

defy them then or else hold close thy lips 

i prithee give no limits to my tongue i am a king and privileged to speak 

my liege the wound that bred this meeting here cannot be cured by words therefore be still 

then executioner unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all i am resolved that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue 

say henry shall i have my right or no a thousand men have broke their fasts to day that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown 

if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armour on 

if that be right which warwick says is right there is no wrong but every thing is right 

whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mother's tongue 

but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul mis shapen stigmatic mark'd by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings 

iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king as if a channel should be call'd the sea shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy base born heart 

a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wrong'd by that false woman as this king by thee his father revell'd in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he match'd according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridal day even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france and heap'd sedition on his crown at home for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slipp'd our claim until another age 

but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring and that thy summer bred us no increase we set the axe to thy usurping root and though the edge hath something hit ourselves yet know thou since we have begun to strike we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods 

and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou deniest the gentle king to speak sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave and either victory or else a grave 

stay edward 

no wrangling woman we'll no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day

ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk broach'd with the steely point of clifford's lance and in the very pangs of death he cried like to a dismal clangour heard from far warwick revenge brother revenge my death so underneath the belly of their steeds that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood the noble gentleman gave up the ghost 

then let the earth be drunken with our blood i'll kill my horse because i will not fly why stand we like soft hearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors here on my knee i vow to god above i'll never pause again never stand still till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge 

o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine and ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with they will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul now lords take leave until we meet again where'er it be in heaven or in earth 

brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick let me embrace thee in my weary arms i that did never weep now melt with woe that winter should cut off our spring time so 

away away once more sweet lords farewell 

yet let us all together to our troops and give them leave to fly that will not stay and call them pillars that will stand to us and if we thrive promise them such rewards as victors wear at the olympian games this may plant courage in their quailing breasts for yet is hope of life and victory forslow no longer make we hence amain

a loud alarum enter clifford wounded

here burns my candle out ay here it dies which whiles it lasted gave king henry light o lancaster i fear thy overthrow more than my body's parting with my soul my love and fear glued many friends to thee and now i fall thy tough commixture melts impairing henry strengthening misproud york the common people swarm like summer flies and whither fly the gnats but to the sun and who shines now but henry's enemies o phoebus hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth and henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do or as thy father and his father did giving no ground unto the house of york they never then had sprung like summer flies i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight the foe is merciless and will not pity for at their hands i have deserved no pity the air hath got into my deadly wounds and much effuse of blood doth make me faint come york and richard warwick and the rest i stabb'd your fathers bosoms split my breast he faints alarum and retreat enter edward george richard montague warwick and soldiers

now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks some troops pursue the bloody minded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves but think you lords that clifford fled with them 

no tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard mark'd him for the grave and wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead clifford groans and dies

whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave 

a deadly groan like life and death's departing 

see who it is and now the battle's ended if friend or foe let him be gently used 

revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford who not contented that he lopp'd the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murdering knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york 

from off the gates of york fetch down the head your father's head which clifford placed there instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answered 

bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak 

i think his understanding is bereft speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say 

o would he did and so perhaps he doth tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father 

if so thou think'st vex him with eager words 

clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace 

clifford repent in bootless penitence 

clifford devise excuses for thy faults 

while we devise fell tortures for thy faults 

thou didst love york and i am son to york 

thou pitied'st rutland i will pity thee 

where's captain margaret to fence you now 

they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont 

what not an oath nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath i know by that he's dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy two hour's life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy 

ay but he's dead off with the traitor's head and rear it in the place your father's stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned england's royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears first will i see the coronation and then to brittany i'll cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord 

even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be for in thy shoulder do i build my seat and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting richard i will create thee duke of gloucester and george of clarence warwick as ourself shall do and undo as him pleaseth best 

let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous 

tut that's a foolish observation richard be duke of gloucester now to london to see these honours in possession

first keeper

under this thick grown brake we'll shroud ourselves for through this laund anon the deer will come and in this covert will we make our stand culling the principal of all the deer 

second keeper

i'll stay above the hill so both may shoot 

first keeper

that cannot be the noise of thy cross bow will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost here stand we both and aim we at the best and for the time shall not seem tedious i'll tell thee what befell me on a day in this self place where now we mean to stand 

second keeper

here comes a man let's stay till he be past enter king henry vi disguised with a prayerbook

from scotland am i stol'n even of pure love to greet mine own land with my wishful sight no harry harry tis no land of thine thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed no bending knee will call thee caesar now no humble suitors press to speak for right no not a man comes for redress of thee for how can i help them and not myself 

first keeper

ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee this is the quondam king let's seize upon him 

let me embrace thee sour adversity for wise men say it is the wisest course 

second keeper

why linger we let us lay hands upon him 

first keeper

forbear awhile we'll hear a little more 

my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french king's sister to wife for edward if this news be true poor queen and son your labour is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words by this account then margaret may win him for she's a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a battery in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn and nero will be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears ay but she's come to beg warwick to give she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward she weeps and says her henry is deposed he smiles and says his edward is install'd that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong inferreth arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edward's place o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn 

second keeper

say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens 

more than i seem and less than i was born to a man at least for less i should not be and men may talk of kings and why not i 

second keeper

ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king 

why so i am in mind and that's enough 

second keeper

but if thou be a king where is thy crown 

my crown is in my heart not on my head not decked with diamonds and indian stones nor to be seen my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy 

second keeper

well if you be a king crown'd with content your crown content and you must be contented to go along with us for as we think you are the king king edward hath deposed and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance will apprehend you as his enemy 

but did you never swear and break an oath 

second keeper

no never such an oath nor will not now 

where did you dwell when i was king of england 

second keeper

here in this country where we now remain 

i was anointed king at nine months old my father and my grandfather were kings and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me then have you not broke your oaths 

first keeper

no for we were subjects but while you were king 

why am i dead do i not breathe a man ah simple men you know not what you swear look as i blow this feather from my face and as the air blows it to me again obeying with my wind when i do blow and yielding to another when it blows commanded always by the greater gust such is the lightness of you common men but do not break your oaths for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty go where you will the king shall be commanded and be you kings command and i'll obey 

first keeper

we are true subjects to the king king edward 

so would you be again to henry if he were seated as king edward is 

first keeper

we charge you in god's name and the king's to go with us unto the officers 

in god's name lead your king's name be obey'd and what god will that let your king perform and what he will i humbly yield unto 

scene ii london the palace 

enter king edward iv gloucester clarence and lady grey

brother of gloucester at saint alban's field this lady's husband sir richard grey was slain his lands then seized on by the conqueror her suit is now to repossess those lands which we in justice cannot well deny because in quarrel of the house of york the worthy gentleman did lose his life 

your highness shall do well to grant her suit it were dishonour to deny it her 

it were no less but yet i'll make a pause 

 aside to clarence yea is it so i see the lady hath a thing to grant before the king will grant her humble suit 

 aside to gloucester he knows the game how true he keeps the wind 

 aside to clarence silence 

widow we will consider of your suit and come some other time to know our mind 

right gracious lord i cannot brook delay may it please your highness to resolve me now and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me 

 aside to clarence ay widow then i'll warrant you all your lands an if what pleases him shall pleasure you fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow 

 aside to gloucester i fear her not unless she chance to fall 

 aside to clarence god forbid that for he'll take vantages 

how many children hast thou widow tell me 

 aside to gloucester i think he means to beg a child of her 

 aside to clarence nay whip me then he'll rather give her two 

three my most gracious lord 

 aside to clarence you shall have four if you'll be ruled by him 

'twere pity they should lose their father's lands 

be pitiful dread lord and grant it then 

lords give us leave i'll try this widow's wit 

 aside to clarence ay good leave have you for you will have leave till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch gloucester and clarence retire

now tell me madam do you love your children 

ay full as dearly as i love myself 

and would you not do much to do them good 

to do them good i would sustain some harm 

then get your husband's lands to do them good 

therefore i came unto your majesty 

i'll tell you how these lands are to be got 

so shall you bind me to your highness service 

what service wilt thou do me if i give them 

what you command that rests in me to do 

but you will take exceptions to my boon 

no gracious lord except i cannot do it 

ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask 

why then i will do what your grace commands 

 aside to clarence he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble 

 aside to gloucester as red as fire nay then her wax must melt 

why stops my lord shall i not hear my task 

an easy task tis but to love a king 

that's soon perform'd because i am a subject 

why then thy husband's lands i freely give thee 

i take my leave with many thousand thanks 

 aside to clarence the match is made she seals it with a curtsy 

but stay thee tis the fruits of love i mean 

the fruits of love i mean my loving liege 

ay but i fear me in another sense what love think'st thou i sue so much to get 

my love till death my humble thanks my prayers that love which virtue begs and virtue grants 

no by my troth i did not mean such love 

why then you mean not as i thought you did 

but now you partly may perceive my mind 

my mind will never grant what i perceive your highness aims at if i aim aright 

to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee 

to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison 

why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands 

why then mine honesty shall be my dower for by that loss i will not purchase them 

therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily 

herein your highness wrongs both them and me but mighty lord this merry inclination accords not with the sadness of my suit please you dismiss me either with ay or no 

ay if thou wilt say ay to my request no if thou dost say no to my demand 

then no my lord my suit is at an end 

 aside to clarence the widow likes him not she knits her brows 

 aside to gloucester he is the bluntest wooer in christendom 

 aside her looks do argue her replete with modesty her words do show her wit incomparable all her perfections challenge sovereignty one way or other she is for a king and she shall be my love or else my queen say that king edward take thee for his queen 

'tis better said than done my gracious lord i am a subject fit to jest withal but far unfit to be a sovereign 

sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love 

and that is more than i will yield unto i know i am too mean to be your queen and yet too good to be your concubine 

you cavil widow i did mean my queen 

'twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father 

no more than when my daughters call thee mother thou art a widow and thou hast some children and by god's mother i being but a bachelor have other some why tis a happy thing to be the father unto many sons answer no more for thou shalt be my queen 

 aside to clarence the ghostly father now hath done his shrift 

 aside to gloucester when he was made a shriver twas for shift 

brothers you muse what chat we two have had 

the widow likes it not for she looks very sad 

you'll think it strange if i should marry her 

to whom my lord 

why clarence to myself 

that would be ten days wonder at the least 

that's a day longer than a wonder lasts 

by so much is the wonder in extremes 

well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband's lands enter a nobleman

see that he be convey'd unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension widow go you along lords use her honourably exeunt all but gloucester

ay edward will use women honourably would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my soul's desire and me the lustful edward's title buried is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he'll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i'll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mother's womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlick'd bear whelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to cheque to o'erbear such as are of better person than myself i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live to account this world but hell until my mis shaped trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk i'll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off i'll pluck it down 

scene iii france king lewis xi's palace 

flourish enter king lewis xi his sister bona his admiral called bourbon prince edward queen margaret and oxford king lewis xi sits and riseth up again

fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit 

no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albion's queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself 

why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair 

from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares 

whate'er it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck to fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be eased if france can yield relief 

those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banish'd man and forced to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england's true anointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henry's heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight 

renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off 

the more we stay the stronger grows our foe 

the more i stay the more i'll succor thee 

o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow enter warwick

what's he approacheth boldly to our presence 

our earl of warwick edward's greatest friend 

welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france he descends she ariseth

ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide 

from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england's king in lawful marriage 

 aside if that go forward henry's hope is done 

 to bona and gracious madam in our king's behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart where fame late entering at his heedful ears hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue 

king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edward's well meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henry's son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs 

injurious margaret 

and why not queen 

because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more are prince than she is queen 

then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends 

oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom's worth 

why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush 

can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king 

call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellow'd years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster 

and i the house of york 

queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick they stand aloof

heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not 

now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen 

thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour 

but is he gracious in the people's eye 

the more that henry was unfortunate 

then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona 

such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain 

now sister let us hear your firm resolve 

your grant or your denial shall be mine to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your king's desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire 

then warwick thus our sister shall be edward's and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoised draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king 

to edward but not to the english king 

deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry's friend 

and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edward's good success then tis but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield 

henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france 

peace impudent and shameless warwick peace proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather post blows a horn within

warwick this is some post to us or thee enter a post

post

 to warwick my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquess montague to king lewis xi these from our king unto your majesty to queen margaret and madam these for you from whom i know not they all read their letters

i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his 

nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled i hope all's for the best 

warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen 

mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys 

mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent 

what has your king married the lady grey and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this the alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner 

i told your majesty as much before this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty 

king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass the abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state 

warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomest king henry's friend 

so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers i'll undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his new made bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me he's very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country 

dear brother how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen 

renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair 

my quarrel and this english queen's are one 

and mine fair lady bona joins with yours 

and mine with hers and thine and margaret's therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid 

let me give humble thanks for all at once 

then england's messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal 

tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly i'll wear the willow garland for his sake 

tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on 

tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long there's thy reward be gone exit post

but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty 

this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands 

yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwick's daughter shall be thine 

yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand he gives his hand to warwick

why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shalt waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by war's mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france exeunt all but warwick

i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and i'll be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry's misery but seek revenge on edward's mockery 

scene i london the palace 

enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague

now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice 

alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return 

my lords forbear this talk here comes the king 

and his well chosen bride 

i mind to tell him plainly what i think flourish enter king edward iv attended queen elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and others

now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent 

as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that they'll take no offence at our abuse 

suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick's and must have my will 

and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well 

yea brother richard are you offended too 

not i no god forbid that i should wish them sever'd whom god hath join'd together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together 

setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england's queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think 

then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona 

and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage 

what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise 

yet to have join'd with france in such alliance would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage 

why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself 

but the safer when tis back'd with france 

'tis better using france than trusting france let us be back'd with god and with the seas which he hath given for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies 

for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford 

ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law 

and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood 

or else you would not have bestow'd the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife's son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere 

alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee 

in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment which being shallow you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you 

leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother's will 

my lords before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow 

my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath 

 aside i hear yet say not much but think the more enter a post

now messenger what letters or what news from france 

post

my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate 

go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters 

post

at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride 

is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage 

post

these were her words utter'd with mad disdain tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly i'll wear the willow garland for his sake 

i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henry's queen for i have heard that she was there in place 

post

'tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on 

belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries 

post

he more incensed against your majesty than all the rest discharged me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long 

ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarn'd they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret 

post

ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick's daughter 

belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick's other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me exit clarence and somerset follows

 aside not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown 

clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect 

so god help montague as he proves true 

and hastings as he favours edward's cause 

now brother richard will you stand by us 

ay in despite of all that shall withstand you 

why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power 

scene ii a plain in warwickshire 

enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers

trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us enter clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence come speak suddenly my lords are we all friends 

fear not that my lord 

then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward's brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in night's coverture thy brother being carelessly encamp'd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well cover'd with the night's black mantle at unawares may beat down edward's guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader they all cry henry why then let's on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george 

scene iii edward's camp near warwick 

enter three watchmen to guard king edward iv's tent

first watchman

come on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep 

second watchman

what will he not to bed 

first watchman

why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd 

second watchman

to morrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report 

third watchman

but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent 

first watchman

'tis the lord hastings the king's chiefest friend 

third watchman

o is it so but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field 

second watchman

'tis the more honour because more dangerous 

third watchman

ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than a dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands tis to be doubted he would waken him 

first watchman

unless our halberds did shut up his passage 

second watchman

ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from night foes enter warwick clarence oxford somerset and french soldiers silent all

this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honour now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours 

first watchman

who goes there 

second watchman

stay or thou diest warwick and the rest cry all warwick warwick and set upon the guard who fly crying arm arm warwick and the rest following them the drum playing and trumpet sounding reenter warwick somerset and the rest bringing king edward iv out in his gown sitting in a chair richard and hastings fly over the stage

what are they that fly there 

richard and hastings let them go here is the duke 

the duke why warwick when we parted thou call'dst me king 

ay but the case is alter'd when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people's welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies 

yea brother of clarence are thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortune's malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel 

then for his mind be edward england's king takes off his crown but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be convey'd unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows i'll follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him now for a while farewell good duke of york they lead him out forcibly

what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide exit guarded

what now remains my lords for us to do but march to london with our soldiers 

ay that's the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne 

scene iv london the palace 

enter queen elizabeth and rivers

madam what makes you in this sudden change 

why brother rivers are you yet to learn what late misfortune is befall'n king edward 

what loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick 

no but the loss of his own royal person 

then is my sovereign slain 

ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner either betray'd by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surprised at unawares and as i further have to understand is new committed to the bishop of york fell warwick's brother and by that our foe 

these news i must confess are full of grief yet gracious madam bear it as you may warwick may lose that now hath won the day 

till then fair hope must hinder life's decay and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edward's offspring in my womb this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortune's cross ay ay for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of blood sucking sighs lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edward's fruit true heir to the english crown 

but madam where is warwick then become 

i am inform'd that he comes towards london to set the crown once more on henry's head guess thou the rest king edward's friends must down but to prevent the tyrant's violence for trust not him that hath once broken faith i'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary to save at least the heir of edward's right there shall i rest secure from force and fraud come therefore let us fly while we may fly if warwick take us we are sure to die 

scene v a park near middleham castle in yorkshire 

enter gloucester hastings and stanley

now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park thus stands the case you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him

huntsman

this way my lord for this way lies the game 

nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishop's deer 

brother the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the park corner 

but whither shall we then 

to lynn my lord and ship from thence to flanders 

well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning 

stanley i will requite thy forwardness 

but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk 

huntsman what say'st thou wilt thou go along 

huntsman

better do so than tarry and be hang'd 

come then away let's ha no more ado 

bishop farewell shield thee from warwick's frown and pray that i may repossess the crown 

scene vi london the tower 

flourish enter king henry vi clarence warwick somerset henry of richmond oxford montague and lieutenant of the tower

master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turn'd my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees 

lieutenant

subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns but if an humble prayer may prevail i then crave pardon of your majesty 

for what lieutenant for well using me nay be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty but warwick after god thou set'st me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument therefore that i may conquer fortune's spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this blessed land may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds 

your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortune's malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place 

no warwick thou art worthy of the sway to whom the heavens in thy nativity adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown as likely to be blest in peace and war and therefore i yield thee my free consent 

and i choose clarence only for protector 

warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise 

what answers clarence to his sovereign's will 

that he consents if warwick yield consent for on thy fortune i repose myself 

why then though loath yet must i be content we'll yoke together like a double shadow to henry's body and supply his place i mean in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate 

what else and that succession be determined 

ay therein clarence shall not want his part 

but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed 

it shall be done my sovereign with all speed 

my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care 

my liege it is young henry earl of richmond 

come hither england's hope lays his hand on his head if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature framed to wear a crown his hand to wield a sceptre and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me enter a post

what news my friend 

post

that edward is escaped from your brother and fled as he hears since to burgundy 

unsavoury news but how made he escape 

post

he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him for hunting was his daily exercise 

my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide exeunt all but somerset henry of richmond and oxford

my lord i like not of this flight of edward's for doubtless burgundy will yield him help and we shall have more wars before t be long as henry's late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts what may befall him to his harm and ours therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst forthwith we'll send him hence to brittany till storms be past of civil enmity 

ay for if edward repossess the crown tis like that richmond with the rest shall down 

it shall be so he shall to brittany come therefore let's about it speedily 

scene vii before york 

flourish enter king edward iv gloucester hastings and soldiers

now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my waned state for henry's regal crown well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas and brought desired help from burgundy what then remains we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom 

the gates made fast brother i like not this for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within 

tush man abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us 

my liege i'll knock once more to summon them enter on the walls the mayor of york and his brethren

mayor

my lords we were forewarned of your coming and shut the gates for safety of ourselves for now we owe allegiance unto henry 

but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york 

mayor

true my good lord i know you for no less 

why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone 

 aside but when the fox hath once got in his nose he'll soon find means to make the body follow 

why master mayor why stand you in a doubt open the gates we are king henry's friends 

mayor

ay say you so the gates shall then be open'd they descend

a wise stout captain and soon persuaded 

the good old man would fain that all were well so twere not long of him but being enter'd i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason enter the mayor and two aldermen below

so master mayor these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war what fear not man but yield me up the keys takes his keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me march enter montgomery with drum and soldiers

brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceived 

welcome sir john but why come you in arms

farewell sweet lords let's meet at coventry exeunt all but king henry vi and exeter

here at the palace i will rest awhile cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine 

the doubt is that he will seduce the rest 

that's not my fear my meed hath got me fame i have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands nor posted off their suits with slow delays my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs my mercy dried their water flowing tears i have not been desirous of their wealth nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies nor forward of revenge though they much err'd then why should they love edward more than me no exeter these graces challenge grace and when the lion fawns upon the lamb the lamb will never cease to follow him shout within a lancaster a lancaster

nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own call warwick patron and be penitent and thou shalt still remain the duke of york 

i thought at least he would have said the king or did he make the jest against his will 

is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift 

ay by my faith for a poor earl to give i'll do thee service for so good a gift 

'twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother 

why then tis mine if but by warwick's gift 

thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject 

but warwick's king is edward's prisoner and gallant warwick do but answer this what is the body when the head is off 

alas that warwick had no more forecast but whiles he thought to steal the single ten the king was slily finger'd from the deck you left poor henry at the bishop's palace and ten to one you'll meet him in the tower 

'tis even so yet you are warwick still 

come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down nay when strike now or else the iron cools 

i had rather chop this hand off at a blow and with the other fling it at thy face than bear so low a sail to strike to thee

father of warwick know you what this means taking his red rose out of his hat look here i throw my infamy at thee i will not ruinate my father's house who gave his blood to lime the stones together and set up lancaster why trow'st thou warwick that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath to keep that oath were more impiety than jephthah's when he sacrificed his daughter i am so sorry for my trespass made that to deserve well at my brother's hands i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe with resolution wheresoe'er i meet thee as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad to plague thee for thy foul misleading me and so proud hearted warwick i defy thee and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks pardon me edward i will make amends and richard do not frown upon my faults for i will henceforth be no more unconstant

ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick why ask i that my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose top branch overpeer'd jove's spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind these eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil have been as piercing as the mid day sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres for who lived king but i could dig his grave and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body's length why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust and live we how we can yet die we must enter oxford and somerset

ah warwick montague hath breathed his last and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick and said commend me to my valiant brother and more he would have said and more he spoke which sounded like a clamour in a vault that mought not be distinguished but at last i well might hear delivered with a groan o farewell warwick 

sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven dies

thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are graced with wreaths of victory but in the midst of this bright shining day i spy a black suspicious threatening cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us 

a little gale will soon disperse that cloud and blow it to the source from whence it came the very beams will dry those vapours up for every cloud engenders not a storm 

the queen is valued thirty thousand strong and somerset with oxford fled to her if she have time to breathe be well assured her faction will be full as strong as ours

great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss but cheerly seek how to redress their harms what though the mast be now blown overboard the cable broke the holding anchor lost and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood yet lives our pilot still is't meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have saved ah what a shame ah what a fault were this say warwick was our anchor what of that and montague our topmost what of him our slaughter'd friends the tackles what of these why is not oxford here another anchor and somerset another goodly mast the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings and though unskilful why not ned and i for once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck as good to chide the waves as speak them fair and what is edward but ruthless sea what clarence but a quicksand of deceit and richard but a ragged fatal rock all these the enemies to our poor bark say you can swim alas tis but a while tread on the sand why there you quickly sink bestride the rock the tide will wash you off or else you famish that's a threefold death this speak i lords to let you understand if case some one of you would fly from us that there's no hoped for mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks why courage then what cannot be avoided twere childish weakness to lament or fear 

methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should if a coward heard her speak these words infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him naked foil a man at arms i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes lest in our need he might infect another and make him of like spirit to himself if any such be here as god forbid let him depart before we need his help 

women and children of so high a courage and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame o brave young prince thy famous grandfather doth live again in thee long mayst thou live to bear his image and renew his glories
