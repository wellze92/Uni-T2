loves labours lost

scene i the king of navarre's park 

enter ferdinand king of navarre biron longaville and dumain

let fame that all hunt after in their lives live register'd upon our brazen tombs and then grace us in the disgrace of death when spite of cormorant devouring time the endeavor of this present breath may buy that honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge and make us heirs of all eternity therefore brave conquerors for so you are that war against your own affections and the huge army of the world's desires our late edict shall strongly stand in force navarre shall be the wonder of the world our court shall be a little academe still and contemplative in living art you three biron dumain and longaville have sworn for three years term to live with me my fellow scholars and to keep those statutes that are recorded in this schedule here your oaths are pass'd and now subscribe your names that his own hand may strike his honour down that violates the smallest branch herein if you are arm'd to do as sworn to do subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too 

i am resolved tis but a three years fast the mind shall banquet though the body pine fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits 

my loving lord dumain is mortified the grosser manner of these world's delights he throws upon the gross world's baser slaves to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die with all these living in philosophy 

i can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrolled there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside the which i hope is not enrolled there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day which i hope well is not enrolled there o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep 

your oath is pass'd to pass away from these 

let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years space 

you swore to that biron and to the rest 

by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest what is the end of study let me know 

why that to know which else we should not know 

things hid and barr'd you mean from common sense 

ay that is study's godlike recompense 

come on then i will swear to study so to know the thing i am forbid to know as thus to study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth if study's gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this and i will ne'er say no 

these be the stops that hinder study quite and train our intellects to vain delight 

why all delights are vain but that most vain which with pain purchased doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by study is like the heaven's glorious sun that will not be deep search'd with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books these earthly godfathers of heaven's lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know nought but fame and every godfather can give a name 

how well he's read to reason against reading 

proceeded well to stop all good proceeding 

he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding 

the spring is near when green geese are a breeding 

how follows that 

fit in his place and time 

in reason nothing 

something then in rhyme 

biron is like an envious sneaping frost that bites the first born infants of the spring 

well say i am why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing why should i joy in any abortive birth at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in may's new fangled mirth but like of each thing that in season grows so you to study now it is too late climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate 

well sit you out go home biron adieu 

no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say yet confident i'll keep what i have swore and bide the penance of each three years day give me the paper let me read the same and to the strict'st decrees i'll write my name 

how well this yielding rescues thee from shame 

 reads item that no woman shall come within a mile of my court hath this been proclaimed 

four days ago 

let's see the penalty reads on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty 

marry that did i 

sweet lord and why 

to fright them hence with that dread penalty 

a dangerous law against gentility reads item if any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise this article my liege yourself must break for well you know here comes in embassy the french king's daughter with yourself to speak a maid of grace and complete majesty about surrender up of aquitaine to her decrepit sick and bedrid father therefore this article is made in vain or vainly comes the admired princess hither 

what say you lords why this was quite forgot 

so study evermore is overshot while it doth study to have what it would it doth forget to do the thing it should and when it hath the thing it hunteth most tis won as towns with fire so won so lost 

we must of force dispense with this decree she must lie here on mere necessity 

necessity will make us all forsworn three thousand times within this three years space for every man with his affects is born not by might master'd but by special grace if i break faith this word shall speak for me i am forsworn on mere necessity so to the laws at large i write my name subscribes and he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame suggestions are to other as to me but i believe although i seem so loath i am the last that will last keep his oath but is there no quick recreation granted 

ay that there is our court you know is haunted with a refined traveller of spain a man in all the world's new fashion planted that hath a mint of phrases in his brain one whom the music of his own vain tongue doth ravish like enchanting harmony a man of complements whom right and wrong have chose as umpire of their mutiny this child of fancy that armado hight for interim to our studies shall relate in high born words the worth of many a knight from tawny spain lost in the world's debate how you delight my lords i know not i but i protest i love to hear him lie and i will use him for my minstrelsy 

armado is a most illustrious wight a man of fire new words fashion's own knight 

costard the swain and he shall be our sport and so to study three years is but short enter dull with a letter and costard

which is the duke's own person 

this fellow what wouldst 

i myself reprehend his own person for i am his grace's tharborough but i would see his own person in flesh and blood 

this is he 

signior arme arme commends you there's villany abroad this letter will tell you more 

sir the contempts thereof are as touching me 

a letter from the magnificent armado 

how low soever the matter i hope in god for high words 

a high hope for a low heaven god grant us patience 

to hear or forbear laughing 

to hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to forbear both 

well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness 

the matter is to me sir as concerning jaquenetta the manner of it is i was taken with the manner 

in what manner 

in manner and form following sir all those three i was seen with her in the manor house sitting with her upon the form and taken following her into the park which put together is in manner and form following now sir for the manner it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form in some form 

for the following sir 

as it shall follow in my correction and god defend the right 

will you hear this letter with attention 

as we would hear an oracle 

such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh 

 reads great deputy the welkin's vicegerent and sole dominator of navarre my soul's earth's god and body's fostering patron 

not a word of costard yet 

 reads so it is 

it may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling true but so 

peace 

be to me and every man that dares not fight 

no words 

of other men's secrets i beseech you 

 reads so it is besieged with sable coloured melancholy i did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health giving air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to walk the time when about the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper so much for the time when now for the ground which which i mean i walked upon it is y cleped thy park then for the place where where i mean i did encounter that obscene and preposterous event that draweth from my snow white pen the ebon coloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest but to the place where it standeth north north east and by east from the west corner of thy curious knotted garden there did i see that low spirited swain that base minnow of thy mirth 

me 

 reads that unlettered small knowing soul 

me 

 reads that shallow vassal 

still me 

 reads which as i remember hight costard 

o me 

 reads sorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon which with o with but with this i passion to say wherewith 

with a wench 

 reads with a child of our grandmother eve a female or for thy more sweet understanding a woman him i as my ever esteemed duty pricks me on have sent to thee to receive the meed of punishment by thy sweet grace's officer anthony dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and estimation 

'me an't shall please you i am anthony dull 

 reads for jaquenetta so is the weaker vessel called which i apprehended with the aforesaid swain i keep her as a vessel of the law's fury and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring her to trial thine in all compliments of devoted and heart burning heat of duty don adriano de armado 

this is not so well as i looked for but the best that ever i heard 

ay the best for the worst but sirrah what say you to this 

sir i confess the wench 

did you hear the proclamation 

i do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking of it 

it was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a wench 

i was taken with none sir i was taken with a damsel 

well it was proclaimed damsel 

this was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin 

it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin 

if it were i deny her virginity i was taken with a maid 

this maid will not serve your turn sir 

this maid will serve my turn sir 

sir i will pronounce your sentence you shall fast a week with bran and water 

i had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge 

and don armado shall be your keeper my lord biron see him deliver'd o'er and go we lords to put in practise that which each to other hath so strongly sworn exeunt ferdinand longaville and dumain

i'll lay my head to any good man's hat these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn sirrah come on 

i suffer for the truth sir for true it is i was taken with jaquenetta and jaquenetta is a true girl and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity affliction may one day smile again and till then sit thee down sorrow love's labours lost

scene ii the same 

enter don adriano de armado and moth

adriano de armado

boy what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy 

a great sign sir that he will look sad don

why sadness is one and the self same thing dear imp 

no no o lord sir no don

how canst thou part sadness and melancholy my tender juvenal 

by a familiar demonstration of the working my tough senior don

why tough senior why tough senior 

why tender juvenal why tender juvenal don

i spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days which we may nominate tender 

and i tough senior as an appertinent title to your old time which we may name tough don adriano de

pretty and apt 

how mean you sir i pretty and my saying apt or i apt and my saying pretty don

thou pretty because little 

little pretty because little wherefore apt don

and therefore apt because quick 

speak you this in my praise master don

in thy condign praise 

i will praise an eel with the same praise don

what that an eel is ingenious 

that an eel is quick don

i do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood 

i am answered sir don

i love not to be crossed 

 aside he speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him don

i have promised to study three years with the duke 

you may do it in an hour sir don

impossible 

how many is one thrice told don

i am ill at reckoning it fitteth the spirit of a tapster 

you are a gentleman and a gamester sir don

i confess both they are both the varnish of a complete man 

then i am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce ace amounts to don

it doth amount to one more than two 

which the base vulgar do call three don

true 

why sir is this such a piece of study now here is three studied ere ye'll thrice wink and how easy it is to put years to the word three and study three years in two words the dancing horse will tell you don

a most fine figure 

to prove you a cipher don

i will hereupon confess i am in love and as it is base for a soldier to love so am i in love with a base wench if drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it i would take desire prisoner and ransom him to any french courtier for a new devised courtesy i think scorn to sigh methinks i should outswear cupid comfort me boy what great men have been in love 

hercules master don

most sweet hercules more authority dear boy name more and sweet my child let them be men of good repute and carriage 

samson master he was a man of good carriage great carriage for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter and he was in love don

o well knit samson strong jointed samson i do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates i am in love too who was samson's love my dear moth 

a woman master don

of what complexion 

of all the four or the three or the two or one of the four don

tell me precisely of what complexion 

of the sea water green sir don

is that one of the four complexions 

as i have read sir and the best of them too don

green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a love of that colour methinks samson had small reason for it he surely affected her for her wit 

it was so sir for she had a green wit don

my love is most immaculate white and red 

most maculate thoughts master are masked under such colours don

define define well educated infant 

my father's wit and my mother's tongue assist me don

sweet invocation of a child most pretty and pathetical 

if she be made of white and red her faults will ne'er be known for blushing cheeks by faults are bred and fears by pale white shown then if she fear or be to blame by this you shall not know for still her cheeks possess the same which native she doth owe a dangerous rhyme master against the reason of white and red don

is there not a ballad boy of the king and the beggar 

the world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since but i think now tis not to be found or if it were it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune don

i will have that subject newly writ o'er that i may example my digression by some mighty precedent boy i do love that country girl that i took in the park with the rational hind costard she deserves well 

 aside to be whipped and yet a better love than my master don

sing boy my spirit grows heavy in love 

and that's great marvel loving a light wench don

i say sing 

forbear till this company be past enter dull costard and jaquenetta

sir the duke's pleasure is that you keep costard safe and you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance but a must fast three days a week for this damsel i must keep her at the park she is allowed for the day woman fare you well don

i do betray myself with blushing maid 

man don

i will visit thee at the lodge 

that's hereby don

i know where it is situate 

lord how wise you are don

i will tell thee wonders 

with that face don

i love thee 

so i heard you say don

and so farewell 

fair weather after you 

come jaquenetta away exeunt dull and jaquenetta don

villain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned 

well sir i hope when i do it i shall do it on a full stomach don

thou shalt be heavily punished 

i am more bound to you than your fellows for they are but lightly rewarded don

take away this villain shut him up 

come you transgressing slave away 

let me not be pent up sir i will fast being loose 

no sir that were fast and loose thou shalt to prison 

well if ever i do see the merry days of desolation that i have seen some shall see 

what shall some see 

nay nothing master moth but what they look upon it is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words and therefore i will say nothing i thank god i have as little patience as another man and therefore i can be quiet exeunt moth and costard don

i do affect the very ground which is base where her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which is basest doth tread i shall be forsworn which is a great argument of falsehood if i love and how can that be true love which is falsely attempted love is a familiar love is a devil there is no evil angel but love yet was samson so tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit cupid's butt shaft is too hard for hercules club and therefore too much odds for a spaniard's rapier the first and second cause will not serve my turn the passado he respects not the duello he regards not his disgrace is to be called boy but his glory is to subdue men adieu valour rust rapier be still drum for your manager is in love yea he loveth assist me some extemporal god of rhyme for i am sure i shall turn sonnet devise wit write pen for i am for whole volumes in folio love's labours lost

scene i the same 

enter the princess of france rosaline maria katharine boyet lords and other attendants

now madam summon up your dearest spirits consider who the king your father sends to whom he sends and what's his embassy yourself held precious in the world's esteem to parley with the sole inheritor of all perfections that a man may owe matchless navarre the plea of no less weight than aquitaine a dowry for a queen be now as prodigal of all dear grace as nature was in making graces dear when she did starve the general world beside and prodigally gave them all to you 

good lord boyet my beauty though but mean needs not the painted flourish of your praise beauty is bought by judgement of the eye not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues i am less proud to hear you tell my worth than you much willing to be counted wise in spending your wit in the praise of mine but now to task the tasker good boyet you are not ignorant all telling fame doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow till painful study shall outwear three years no woman may approach his silent court therefore to's seemeth it a needful course before we enter his forbidden gates to know his pleasure and in that behalf bold of your worthiness we single you as our best moving fair solicitor tell him the daughter of the king of france on serious business craving quick dispatch importunes personal conference with his grace haste signify so much while we attend like humble visaged suitors his high will 

proud of employment willingly i go 

all pride is willing pride and yours is so exit boyet who are the votaries my loving lords that are vow fellows with this virtuous duke 

first lord

lord longaville is one 

know you the man 

i know him madam at a marriage feast between lord perigort and the beauteous heir of jaques falconbridge solemnized in normandy saw i this longaville a man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd well fitted in arts glorious in arms nothing becomes him ill that he would well the only soil of his fair virtue's gloss if virtue's gloss will stain with any soil is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills it should none spare that come within his power 

some merry mocking lord belike is't so 

they say so most that most his humours know 

such short lived wits do wither as they grow who are the rest 

the young dumain a well accomplished youth of all that virtue love for virtue loved most power to do most harm least knowing ill for he hath wit to make an ill shape good and shape to win grace though he had no wit i saw him at the duke alencon's once and much too little of that good i saw is my report to his great worthiness 

another of these students at that time was there with him if i have heard a truth biron they call him but a merrier man within the limit of becoming mirth i never spent an hour's talk withal his eye begets occasion for his wit for every object that the one doth catch the other turns to a mirth moving jest which his fair tongue conceit's expositor delivers in such apt and gracious words that aged ears play truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravished so sweet and voluble is his discourse 

god bless my ladies are they all in love that every one her own hath garnished with such bedecking ornaments of praise 

first lord

here comes boyet re enter boyet

now what admittance lord 

navarre had notice of your fair approach and he and his competitors in oath were all address'd to meet you gentle lady before i came marry thus much i have learnt he rather means to lodge you in the field like one that comes here to besiege his court than seek a dispensation for his oath to let you enter his unpeopled house here comes navarre enter ferdinand longaville dumain biron and attendants

fair princess welcome to the court of navarre 

'fair i give you back again and welcome i have not yet the roof of this court is too high to be yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine 

you shall be welcome madam to my court 

i will be welcome then conduct me thither 

hear me dear lady i have sworn an oath 

our lady help my lord he'll be forsworn 

not for the world fair madam by my will 

why will shall break it will and nothing else 

your ladyship is ignorant what it is 

were my lord so his ignorance were wise where now his knowledge must prove ignorance i hear your grace hath sworn out house keeping tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord and sin to break it but pardon me i am too sudden bold to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming and suddenly resolve me in my suit 

madam i will if suddenly i may 

you will the sooner that i were away for you'll prove perjured if you make me stay 

did not i dance with you in brabant once 

did not i dance with you in brabant once 

i know you did 

how needless was it then to ask the question 

you must not be so quick 

'tis long of you that spur me with such questions 

your wit's too hot it speeds too fast twill tire 

not till it leave the rider in the mire 

what time o day 

the hour that fools should ask 

now fair befall your mask 

fair fall the face it covers 

and send you many lovers 

amen so you be none 

nay then will i be gone 

madam your father here doth intimate the payment of a hundred thousand crowns being but the one half of an entire sum disbursed by my father in his wars but say that he or we as neither have received that sum yet there remains unpaid a hundred thousand more in surety of the which one part of aquitaine is bound to us although not valued to the money's worth if then the king your father will restore but that one half which is unsatisfied we will give up our right in aquitaine and hold fair friendship with his majesty but that it seems he little purposeth for here he doth demand to have repaid a hundred thousand crowns and not demands on payment of a hundred thousand crowns to have his title live in aquitaine which we much rather had depart withal and have the money by our father lent than aquitaine so gelded as it is dear princess were not his requests so far from reason's yielding your fair self should make a yielding gainst some reason in my breast and go well satisfied to france again 

you do the king my father too much wrong and wrong the reputation of your name in so unseeming to confess receipt of that which hath so faithfully been paid 

i do protest i never heard of it and if you prove it i'll repay it back or yield up aquitaine 

we arrest your word boyet you can produce acquittances for such a sum from special officers of charles his father 

satisfy me so 

so please your grace the packet is not come where that and other specialties are bound to morrow you shall have a sight of them 

it shall suffice me at which interview all liberal reason i will yield unto meantime receive such welcome at my hand as honour without breach of honour may make tender of to thy true worthiness you may not come fair princess in my gates but here without you shall be so received as you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart though so denied fair harbour in my house your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell to morrow shall we visit you again 

sweet health and fair desires consort your grace 

thy own wish wish i thee in every place

to her will sir or so 

you are welcome sir adieu 

farewell to me sir and welcome to you exit biron

that last is biron the merry madcap lord not a word with him but a jest 

and every jest but a word 

it was well done of you to take him at his word 

i was as willing to grapple as he was to board 

two hot sheeps marry 

and wherefore not ships no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips 

you sheep and i pasture shall that finish the jest 

so you grant pasture for me offering to kiss her

not so gentle beast my lips are no common though several they be 

belonging to whom 

to my fortunes and me 

good wits will be jangling but gentles agree this civil war of wits were much better used on navarre and his book men for here tis abused 

if my observation which very seldom lies by the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes deceive me not now navarre is infected 

with what 

with that which we lovers entitle affected 

your reason 

why all his behaviors did make their retire to the court of his eye peeping thorough desire his heart like an agate with your print impress'd proud with his form in his eye pride express'd his tongue all impatient to speak and not see did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be all senses to that sense did make their repair to feel only looking on fairest of fair methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy who tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd did point you to buy them along as you pass'd his face's own margent did quote such amazes that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes i'll give you aquitaine and all that is his an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss 

come to our pavilion boyet is disposed 

but to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed i only have made a mouth of his eye by adding a tongue which i know will not lie 

thou art an old love monger and speakest skilfully 

he is cupid's grandfather and learns news of him 

then was venus like her mother for her father is but grim 

do you hear my mad wenches 

no 

what then do you see 

ay our way to be gone 

you are too hard for me love's labours lost

sweet air go tenderness of years take this key give enlargement to the swain bring him festinately hither i must employ him in a letter to my love 

master will you win your love with a french brawl don

how meanest thou brawling in french 

no my complete master but to jig off a tune at the tongue's end canary to it with your feet humour it with turning up your eyelids sigh a note and sing a note sometime through the throat as if you swallowed love with singing love sometime through the nose as if you snuffed up love by smelling love with your hat penthouse like o'er the shop of your eyes with your arms crossed on your thin belly doublet like a rabbit on a spit or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting and keep not too long in one tune but a snip and away these are complements these are humours these betray nice wenches that would be betrayed without these and make them men of note do you note me that most are affected to these don

how hast thou purchased this experience

enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull

very reverend sport truly and done in the testimony of a good conscience 

the deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe as the pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo the sky the welkin the heaven and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra the soil the land the earth 

truly master holofernes the epithets are sweetly varied like a scholar at the least but sir i assure ye it was a buck of the first head 

sir nathaniel haud credo 

'twas not a haud credo twas a pricket 

most barbarous intimation yet a kind of insinuation as it were in via in way of explication facere as it were replication or rather ostentare to show as it were his inclination after his undressed unpolished uneducated unpruned untrained or rather unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion to insert again my haud credo for a deer 

i said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket 

twice sod simplicity his coctus o thou monster ignorance how deformed dost thou look 

sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book he hath not eat paper as it were he hath not drunk ink his intellect is not replenished he is only an animal only sensible in the duller parts and such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that do fructify in us more than he for as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool so were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school but omne bene say i being of an old father's mind many can brook the weather that love not the wind 

you two are book men can you tell me by your wit what was a month old at cain's birth that's not five weeks old as yet 

dictynna goodman dull dictynna goodman dull 

what is dictynna 

a title to phoebe to luna to the moon 

the moon was a month old when adam was no more and raught not to five weeks when he came to five score the allusion holds in the exchange 

'tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange 

god comfort thy capacity i say the allusion holds in the exchange 

and i say the pollusion holds in the exchange for the moon is never but a month old and i say beside that twas a pricket that the princess killed 

sir nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer and to humour the ignorant call i the deer the princess killed a pricket 

perge good master holofernes perge so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility 

i will something affect the letter for it argues facility the preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty pleasing pricket some say a sore but not a sore till now made sore with shooting the dogs did yell put l to sore then sorel jumps from thicket or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall a hooting if sore be sore then l to sore makes fifty sores one sorel of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more l 

a rare talent 

 aside if a talent be a claw look how he claws him with a talent 

this is a gift that i have simple simple a foolish extravagant spirit full of forms figures shapes objects ideas apprehensions motions revolutions these are begot in the ventricle of memory nourished in the womb of pia mater and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion but the gift is good in those in whom it is acute and i am thankful for it 

sir i praise the lord for you and so may my parishioners for their sons are well tutored by you and their daughters profit very greatly under you you are a good member of the commonwealth

 reads so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not to those fresh morning drops upon the rose as thy eye beams when their fresh rays have smote the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows nor shines the silver moon one half so bright through the transparent bosom of the deep as doth thy face through tears of mine give light thou shinest in every tear that i do weep no drop but as a coach doth carry thee so ridest thou triumphing in my woe do but behold the tears that swell in me and they thy glory through my grief will show but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep my tears for glasses and still make me weep o queen of queens how far dost thou excel no thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell how shall she know my griefs i'll drop the paper sweet leaves shade folly who is he comes here steps aside what longaville and reading listen ear

one drunkard loves another of the name 

am i the first that have been perjured so 

i could put thee in comfort not by two that i know thou makest the triumviry the corner cap of society the shape of love's tyburn that hangs up simplicity 

i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move o sweet maria empress of my love these numbers will i tear and write in prose 

o rhymes are guards on wanton cupid's hose disfigure not his slop 

this same shall go reads did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye gainst whom the world cannot hold argument persuade my heart to this false perjury vows for thee broke deserve not punishment a woman i forswore but i will prove thou being a goddess i forswore not thee my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me vows are but breath and breath a vapour is then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine exhalest this vapour vow in thee it is if broken then it is no fault of mine if by me broke what fool is not so wise to lose an oath to win a paradise

o most divine kate 

o most profane coxcomb 

by heaven the wonder in a mortal eye 

by earth she is not corporal there you lie 

her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted 

an amber colour'd raven was well noted

amen so i had mine is not that a good word 

i would forget her but a fever she reigns in my blood and will remember'd be 

a fever in your blood why then incision would let her out in saucers sweet misprision 

once more i'll read the ode that i have writ 

once more i'll mark how love can vary wit 

 reads on a day alack the day love whose month is ever may spied a blossom passing fair playing in the wanton air through the velvet leaves the wind all unseen can passage find that the lover sick to death wish himself the heaven's breath air quoth he thy cheeks may blow air would i might triumph so but alack my hand is sworn ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn vow alack for youth unmeet youth so apt to pluck a sweet do not call it sin in me that i am forsworn for thee thou for whom jove would swear juno but an ethiope were and deny himself for jove turning mortal for thy love this will i send and something else more plain that shall express my true love's fasting pain o would the king biron and longaville were lovers too ill to example ill would from my forehead wipe a perjured note for none offend where all alike do dote 

 advancing dumain thy love is far from charity you may look pale but i should blush i know to be o'erheard and taken napping so 

 advancing come sir you blush as his your case is such you chide at him offending twice as much you do not love maria longaville did never sonnet for her sake compile nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart his loving bosom to keep down his heart i have been closely shrouded in this bush and mark'd you both and for you both did blush i heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion ay me says one o jove the other cries one her hairs were gold crystal the other's eyes to longaville you would for paradise break faith and troth to dumain and jove for your love would infringe an oath what will biron say when that he shall hear faith so infringed which such zeal did swear how will he scorn how will he spend his wit how will he triumph leap and laugh at it for all the wealth that ever i did see i would not have him know so much by me 

now step i forth to whip hypocrisy advancing ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove these worms for loving that art most in love your eyes do make no coaches in your tears there is no certain princess that appears you'll not be perjured tis a hateful thing tush none but minstrels like of sonneting but are you not ashamed nay are you not all three of you to be thus much o'ershot you found his mote the king your mote did see but i a beam do find in each of three o what a scene of foolery have i seen of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen o me with what strict patience have i sat to see a king transformed to a gnat to see great hercules whipping a gig and profound solomon to tune a jig and nestor play at push pin with the boys and critic timon laugh at idle toys where lies thy grief o tell me good dumain and gentle longaville where lies thy pain and where my liege's all about the breast a caudle ho 

too bitter is thy jest are we betray'd thus to thy over view 

not you to me but i betray'd by you i that am honest i that hold it sin to break the vow i am engaged in i am betray'd by keeping company with men like men of inconstancy when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme or groan for love or spend a minute's time in pruning me when shall you hear that i will praise a hand a foot a face an eye a gait a state a brow a breast a waist a leg a limb 

soft whither away so fast a true man or a thief that gallops so 

i post from love good lover let me go enter jaquenetta and costard

god bless the king 

what present hast thou there 

some certain treason 

what makes treason here 

nay it makes nothing sir 

if it mar nothing neither the treason and you go in peace away together 

i beseech your grace let this letter be read our parson misdoubts it twas treason he said 

biron read it over giving him the paper where hadst thou it 

of costard 

where hadst thou it 

of dun adramadio dun adramadio biron tears the letter

how now what is in you why dost thou tear it 

a toy my liege a toy your grace needs not fear it 

it did move him to passion and therefore let's hear it 

it is biron's writing and here is his name gathering up the pieces

 to costard ah you whoreson loggerhead you were born to do me shame guilty my lord guilty i confess i confess 

what 

that you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess he he and you and you my liege and i are pick purses in love and we deserve to die o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more 

now the number is even 

true true we are four will these turtles be gone 

hence sirs away 

walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay exeunt costard and jaquenetta

sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace as true we are as flesh and blood can be the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face young blood doth not obey an old decree we cannot cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn 

what did these rent lines show some love of thine 

did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of inde at the first opening of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eagle sighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty 

what zeal what fury hath inspired thee now my love her mistress is a gracious moon she an attending star scarce seen a light 

my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a seller's praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a wither'd hermit five score winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if new born and gives the crutch the cradle's infancy o tis the sun that maketh all things shine 

by heaven thy love is black as ebony 

is ebony like her o wood divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black 

o paradox black is the badge of hell the hue of dungeons and the suit of night and beauty's crest becomes the heavens well 

devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my lady's brows be deck'd it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favour turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow 

to look like her are chimney sweepers black 

and since her time are colliers counted bright 

and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack 

dark needs no candles now for dark is light 

your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colours should be wash'd away 

'twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain i'll find a fairer face not wash'd to day 

i'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here 

no devil will fright thee then so much as she 

i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear 

look here's thy love my foot and her face see 

o if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread 

o vile then as she goes what upward lies the street should see as she walk'd overhead 

but what of this are we not all in love 

nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn 

then leave this chat and good biron now prove our loving lawful and our faith not torn 

ay marry there some flattery for this evil 

o some authority how to proceed some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil 

some salve for perjury 

'tis more than need have at you then affection's men at arms consider what you first did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth say can you fast your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies and where that you have vow'd to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of study's excellence without the beauty of a woman's face from women's eyes this doctrine i derive they are the ground the books the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and long during action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller now for not looking on a woman's face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is any author in the world teaches such beauty as a woman's eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a lady's eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd love's feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollo's lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temper'd with love's sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from women's eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdom's sake a word that all men love or for love's sake a word that loves all men or for men's sake the authors of these women or women's sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity 

saint cupid then and soldiers to the field 

advance your standards and upon them lords pell mell down with them but be first advised in conflict that you get the sun of them 

now to plain dealing lay these glozes by shall we resolve to woo these girls of france 

and win them too therefore let us devise some entertainment for them in their tents 

first from the park let us conduct them thither then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress in the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them such as the shortness of the time can shape for revels dances masks and merry hours forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers 

away away no time shall be omitted that will betime and may by us be fitted

novi hominem tanquam te his humour is lofty his discourse peremptory his tongue filed his eye ambitious his gait majestical and his general behavior vain ridiculous and thrasonical he is too picked too spruce too affected too odd as it were too peregrinate as i may call it 

a most singular and choice epithet draws out his table book

he draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument i abhor such fanatical phantasimes such insociable and point devise companions such rackers of orthography as to speak dout fine when he should say doubt det when he should pronounce debt d e b t not d e t he clepeth a calf cauf half hauf neighbour vocatur nebor neigh abbreviated ne this is abhominable which he would call abbominable it insinuateth me of insanie anne intelligis domine to make frantic lunatic

sir it is the king's most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day which the rude multitude call the afternoon 

the posterior of the day most generous sir is liable congruent and measurable for the afternoon the word is well culled chose sweet and apt i do assure you sir i do assure don

sir the king is a noble gentleman and my familiar i do assure ye very good friend for what is inward between us let it pass i do beseech thee remember thy courtesy i beseech thee apparel thy head and among other important and most serious designs and of great import indeed too but let that pass for i must tell thee it will please his grace by the world sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally with my excrement with my mustachio but sweet heart let that pass by the world i recount no fable some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart to armado a soldier a man of travel that hath seen the world but let that pass the very all of all is but sweet heart i do implore secrecy that the king would have me present the princess sweet chuck with some delightful ostentation or show or pageant or antique or firework now understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth as it were i have acquainted you withal to the end to crave your assistance 

sir you shall present before her the nine worthies sir as concerning some entertainment of time some show in the posterior of this day to be rendered by our assistants at the king's command and this most gallant illustrate and learned gentleman before the princess i say none so fit as to present the nine worthies 

where will you find men worthy enough to present them 

joshua yourself myself and this gallant gentleman judas maccabaeus this swain because of his great limb or joint shall pass pompey the great the page hercules don

pardon sir error he is not quantity enough for that worthy's thumb he is not so big as the end of his club 

shall i have audience he shall present hercules in minority his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake and i will have an apology for that purpose 

an excellent device so if any of the audience hiss you may cry well done hercules now thou crushest the snake that is the way to make an offence gracious though few have the grace to do it don

for the rest of the worthies 

i will play three myself 

thrice worthy gentleman don

via goodman dull thou hast spoken no word all this while 

nor understood none neither sir 

allons we will employ thee 

i'll make one in a dance or so or i will play on the tabour to the worthies and let them dance the hay 

most dull honest dull to our sport away love's labours lost

scene ii the same 

enter the princess katharine rosaline and maria

sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart if fairings come thus plentifully in a lady wall'd about with diamonds look you what i have from the loving king 

madame came nothing else along with that 

nothing but this yes as much love in rhyme as would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper writ o both sides the leaf margent and all that he was fain to seal on cupid's name 

that was the way to make his godhead wax for he hath been five thousand years a boy 

ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too 

you'll ne'er be friends with him a kill'd your sister 

he made her melancholy sad and heavy and so she died had she been light like you of such a merry nimble stirring spirit she might ha been a grandam ere she died and so may you for a light heart lives long 

what's your dark meaning mouse of this light word 

a light condition in a beauty dark 

we need more light to find your meaning out 

you'll mar the light by taking it in snuff therefore i'll darkly end the argument 

look what you do you do it still i the dark 

so do not you for you are a light wench 

indeed i weigh not you and therefore light 

you weigh me not o that's you care not for me 

great reason for past cure is still past care 

well bandied both a set of wit well play'd but rosaline you have a favour too who sent it and what is it 

i would you knew an if my face were but as fair as yours my favour were as great be witness this nay i have verses too i thank biron the numbers true and were the numbering too i were the fairest goddess on the ground i am compared to twenty thousand fairs o he hath drawn my picture in his letter 

any thing like 

much in the letters nothing in the praise 

beauteous as ink a good conclusion 

fair as a text b in a copy book 

'ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor my red dominical my golden letter o that your face were not so full of o's 

a pox of that jest and i beshrew all shrows 

but katharine what was sent to you from fair dumain 

madam this glove 

did he not send you twain 

yes madam and moreover some thousand verses of a faithful lover a huge translation of hypocrisy vilely compiled profound simplicity 

this and these pearls to me sent longaville the letter is too long by half a mile 

i think no less dost thou not wish in heart the chain were longer and the letter short 

ay or i would these hands might never part 

we are wise girls to mock our lovers so 

they are worse fools to purchase mocking so that same biron i'll torture ere i go o that i knew he were but in by the week how i would make him fawn and beg and seek and wait the season and observe the times and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes and shape his service wholly to my hests and make him proud to make me proud that jests so perttaunt like would i o'ersway his state that he should be my fool and i his fate 

none are so surely caught when they are catch'd as wit turn'd fool folly in wisdom hatch'd hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school and wit's own grace to grace a learned fool 

the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity's revolt to wantonness 

folly in fools bears not so strong a note as foolery in the wise when wit doth dote since all the power thereof it doth apply to prove by wit worth in simplicity 

here comes boyet and mirth is in his face enter boyet

o i am stabb'd with laughter where's her grace 

thy news boyet 

prepare madam prepare arm wenches arm encounters mounted are against your peace love doth approach disguised armed in arguments you'll be surprised muster your wits stand in your own defence or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence 

saint denis to saint cupid what are they that charge their breath against us say scout say 

under the cool shade of a sycamore i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour when lo to interrupt my purposed rest toward that shade i might behold addrest the king and his companions warily i stole into a neighbour thicket by and overheard what you shall overhear that by and by disguised they will be here their herald is a pretty knavish page that well by heart hath conn'd his embassage action and accent did they teach him there thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear and ever and anon they made a doubt presence majestical would put him out for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see yet fear not thou but speak audaciously the boy replied an angel is not evil i should have fear'd her had she been a devil with that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder making the bold wag by their praises bolder one rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore a better speech was never spoke before another with his finger and his thumb cried via we will do't come what will come the third he caper'd and cried all goes well the fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell with that they all did tumble on the ground with such a zealous laughter so profound that in this spleen ridiculous appears to cheque their folly passion's solemn tears 

but what but what come they to visit us 

they do they do and are apparell'd thus like muscovites or russians as i guess their purpose is to parle to court and dance and every one his love feat will advance unto his several mistress which they'll know by favours several which they did bestow 

and will they so the gallants shall be task'd for ladies we shall every one be mask'd and not a man of them shall have the grace despite of suit to see a lady's face hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear and then the king will court thee for his dear hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine so shall biron take me for rosaline and change your favours too so shall your loves woo contrary deceived by these removes 

come on then wear the favours most in sight 

but in this changing what is your intent 

the effect of my intent is to cross theirs they do it but in mocking merriment and mock for mock is only my intent their several counsels they unbosom shall to loves mistook and so be mock'd withal upon the next occasion that we meet with visages displayed to talk and greet 

but shall we dance if they desire to't 

no to the death we will not move a foot nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace but while tis spoke each turn away her face 

why that contempt will kill the speaker's heart and quite divorce his memory from his part 

therefore i do it and i make no doubt the rest will ne'er come in if he be out there's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown to make theirs ours and ours none but our own so shall we stay mocking intended game and they well mock'd depart away with shame trumpets sound within

the trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers come the ladies mask enter blackamoors with music moth ferdinand biron longaville and dumain in russian habits and masked

all hail the richest beauties on the earth 

beauties no richer than rich taffeta 

a holy parcel of the fairest dames the ladies turn their backs to him that ever turn'd their backs to mortal views 

 aside to moth their eyes villain their eyes 

that ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views out 

true out indeed 

out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe not to behold 

 aside to moth once to behold rogue 

once to behold with your sun beamed eyes with your sun beamed eyes 

they will not answer to that epithet you were best call it daughter beamed eyes 

they do not mark me and that brings me out 

is this your perfectness be gone you rogue exit moth

what would these strangers know their minds boyet if they do speak our language tis our will that some plain man recount their purposes know what they would 

what would you with the princess 

nothing but peace and gentle visitation 

what would they say they 

nothing but peace and gentle visitation 

why that they have and bid them so be gone 

she says you have it and you may be gone 

say to her we have measured many miles to tread a measure with her on this grass 

they say that they have measured many a mile to tread a measure with you on this grass 

it is not so ask them how many inches is in one mile if they have measured many the measure then of one is easily told 

if to come hither you have measured miles and many miles the princess bids you tell how many inches doth fill up one mile 

tell her we measure them by weary steps 

she hears herself 

how many weary steps of many weary miles you have o'ergone are number'd in the travel of one mile 

we number nothing that we spend for you our duty is so rich so infinite that we may do it still without accompt vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face that we like savages may worship it 

my face is but a moon and clouded too 

blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine those clouds removed upon our watery eyne 

o vain petitioner beg a greater matter thou now request'st but moonshine in the water 

then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change thou bid'st me beg this begging is not strange 

play music then nay you must do it soon music plays not yet no dance thus change i like the moon 

will you not dance how come you thus estranged 

you took the moon at full but now she's changed 

yet still she is the moon and i the man the music plays vouchsafe some motion to it 

our ears vouchsafe it 

but your legs should do it 

since you are strangers and come here by chance we'll not be nice take hands we will not dance 

why take we hands then 

only to part friends curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends 

more measure of this measure be not nice 

we can afford no more at such a price 

prize you yourselves what buys your company 

your absence only 

that can never be 

then cannot we be bought and so adieu twice to your visor and half once to you 

if you deny to dance let's hold more chat 

in private then 

i am best pleased with that they converse apart

white handed mistress one sweet word with thee 

honey and milk and sugar there is three 

nay then two treys and if you grow so nice metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice there's half a dozen sweets 

seventh sweet adieu since you can cog i'll play no more with you 

one word in secret 

let it not be sweet 

thou grievest my gall 

gall bitter 

therefore meet they converse apart

will you vouchsafe with me to change a word 

name it 

fair lady 

say you so fair lord take that for your fair lady 

please it you as much in private and i'll bid adieu they converse apart

what was your vizard made without a tongue 

i know the reason lady why you ask 

o for your reason quickly sir i long 

you have a double tongue within your mask and would afford my speechless vizard half 

veal quoth the dutchman is not veal a calf 

a calf fair lady 

no a fair lord calf 

let's part the word 

no i'll not be your half take all and wean it it may prove an ox 

look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks will you give horns chaste lady do not so 

then die a calf before your horns do grow 

one word in private with you ere i die 

bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry they converse apart

the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen as is the razor's edge invisible cutting a smaller hair than may be seen above the sense of sense so sensible seemeth their conference their conceits have wings fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things 

not one word more my maids break off break off 

by heaven all dry beaten with pure scoff 

farewell mad wenches you have simple wits 

twenty adieus my frozen muscovits exeunt ferdinand lords and blackamoors are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at 

tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff'd out 

well liking wits they have gross gross fat fat 

o poverty in wit kingly poor flout will they not think you hang themselves tonight or ever but in vizards show their faces this pert biron was out of countenance quite 

o they were all in lamentable cases the king was weeping ripe for a good word 

biron did swear himself out of all suit 

dumain was at my service and his sword no point quoth i my servant straight was mute 

lord longaville said i came o'er his heart and trow you what he called me 

qualm perhaps 

yes in good faith 

go sickness as thou art 

well better wits have worn plain statute caps but will you hear the king is my love sworn 

and quick biron hath plighted faith to me 

and longaville was for my service born 

dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree 

madam and pretty mistresses give ear immediately they will again be here in their own shapes for it can never be they will digest this harsh indignity 

will they return 

they will they will god knows and leap for joy though they are lame with blows therefore change favours and when they repair blow like sweet roses in this summer air 

how blow how blow speak to be understood 

fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud dismask'd their damask sweet commixture shown are angels vailing clouds or roses blown 

avaunt perplexity what shall we do if they return in their own shapes to woo 

good madam if by me you'll be advised let's mock them still as well known as disguised let us complain to them what fools were here disguised like muscovites in shapeless gear and wonder what they were and to what end their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd and their rough carriage so ridiculous should be presented at our tent to us 

ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand 

whip to our tents as roes run o'er land exeunt princess rosaline katharine and maria re enter ferdinand biron longaville and dumain in their proper habits

fair sir god save you where's the princess 

gone to her tent please it your majesty command me any service to her thither 

that she vouchsafe me audience for one word 

i will and so will she i know my lord 

this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease and utters it again when god doth please he is wit's pedler and retails his wares at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs and we that sell by gross the lord doth know have not the grace to grace it with such show this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve had he been adam he had tempted eve a can carve too and lisp why this is he that kiss'd his hand away in courtesy this is the ape of form monsieur the nice that when he plays at tables chides the dice in honourable terms nay he can sing a mean most meanly and in ushering mend him who can the ladies call him sweet the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet this is the flower that smiles on every one to show his teeth as white as whale's bone and consciences that will not die in debt pay him the due of honey tongued boyet 

a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart that put armado's page out of his part 

see where it comes behavior what wert thou till this madman show'd thee and what art thou now re enter the princess ushered by boyet rosaline maria and katharine

all hail sweet madam and fair time of day 

'fair in all hail is foul as i conceive 

construe my speeches better if you may 

then wish me better i will give you leave 

we came to visit you and purpose now to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then 

this field shall hold me and so hold your vow nor god nor i delights in perjured men 

rebuke me not for that which you provoke the virtue of your eye must break my oath 

you nickname virtue vice you should have spoke for virtue's office never breaks men's troth now by my maiden honour yet as pure as the unsullied lily i protest a world of torments though i should endure i would not yield to be your house's guest so much i hate a breaking cause to be of heavenly oaths vow'd with integrity 

o you have lived in desolation here unseen unvisited much to our shame 

not so my lord it is not so i swear we have had pastimes here and pleasant game a mess of russians left us but of late 

how madam russians 

ay in truth my lord trim gallants full of courtship and of state 

madam speak true it is not so my lord my lady to the manner of the days in courtesy gives undeserving praise we four indeed confronted were with four in russian habit here they stay'd an hour and talk'd apace and in that hour my lord they did not bless us with one happy word i dare not call them fools but this i think when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink 

this jest is dry to me fair gentle sweet your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet with eyes best seeing heaven's fiery eye by light we lose light your capacity is of that nature that to your huge store wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor 

this proves you wise and rich for in my eye 

i am a fool and full of poverty 

but that you take what doth to you belong it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue 

o i am yours and all that i possess 

all the fool mine 

i cannot give you less 

which of the vizards was it that you wore 

where when what vizard why demand you this 

there then that vizard that superfluous case that hid the worse and show'd the better face 

we are descried they'll mock us now downright 

let us confess and turn it to a jest 

amazed my lord why looks your highness sad 

help hold his brows he'll swoon why look you pale sea sick i think coming from muscovy 

thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury can any face of brass hold longer out 

here stand i

lady dart thy skill at me bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit and i will wish thee never more to dance nor never more in russian habit wait o never will i trust to speeches penn'd nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue nor never come in vizard to my friend nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper's song taffeta phrases silken terms precise three piled hyperboles spruce affectation figures pedantical these summer flies have blown me full of maggot ostentation i do forswear them and i here protest by this white glove how white the hand god knows henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd in russet yeas and honest kersey noes and to begin wench so god help me la my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw 

sans sans i pray you 

yet i have a trick of the old rage bear with me i am sick i'll leave it by degrees soft let us see write lord have mercy on us on those three they are infected in their hearts it lies they have the plague and caught it of your eyes these lords are visited you are not free for the lord's tokens on you do i see 

no they are free that gave these tokens to us 

our states are forfeit seek not to undo us 

it is not so for how can this be true that you stand forfeit being those that sue 

peace for i will not have to do with you 

nor shall not if i do as i intend 

speak for yourselves my wit is at an end 

teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression some fair excuse 

the fairest is confession were not you here but even now disguised 

madam i was 

and were you well advised 

i was fair madam 

when you then were here what did you whisper in your lady's ear 

that more than all the world i did respect her 

when she shall challenge this you will reject her 

upon mine honour no 

peace peace forbear your oath once broke you force not to forswear 

despise me when i break this oath of mine 

i will and therefore keep it rosaline what did the russian whisper in your ear 

madam he swore that he did hold me dear as precious eyesight and did value me above this world adding thereto moreover that he would wed me or else die my lover 

god give thee joy of him the noble lord most honourably doth unhold his word 

what mean you madam by my life my troth i never swore this lady such an oath 

by heaven you did and to confirm it plain you gave me this but take it sir again 

my faith and this the princess i did give i knew her by this jewel on her sleeve 

pardon me sir this jewel did she wear and lord biron i thank him is my dear what will you have me or your pearl again 

neither of either i remit both twain i see the trick on't here was a consent knowing aforehand of our merriment to dash it like a christmas comedy some carry tale some please man some slight zany some mumble news some trencher knight some dick that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick to make my lady laugh when she's disposed told our intents before which once disclosed the ladies did change favours and then we following the signs woo'd but the sign of she now to our perjury to add more terror we are again forsworn in will and error much upon this it is and might not you to boyet forestall our sport to make us thus untrue do not you know my lady's foot by the squier and laugh upon the apple of her eye and stand between her back sir and the fire holding a trencher jesting merrily you put our page out go you are allow'd die when you will a smock shall be your shroud you leer upon me do you there's an eye wounds like a leaden sword 

full merrily hath this brave manage this career been run 

lo he is tilting straight peace i have done enter costard welcome pure wit thou partest a fair fray

his leg is too big for hector's 

more calf certain

the party is gone fellow hector she is gone she is two months on her way don

what meanest thou 

faith unless you play the honest troyan the poor wench is cast away she's quick the child brags in her belly already tis yours don

dost thou infamonize me among potentates thou shalt die 

then shall hector be whipped for jaquenetta that is quick by him and hanged for pompey that is dead by him 

most rare pompey 

renowned pompey 

greater than great great great great pompey pompey the huge 

hector trembles 

pompey is moved more ates more ates stir them on stir them on

sweet bloods i both may and will 

what reason have you for't don

the naked truth of it is i have no shirt i go woolward for penance 

true and it was enjoined him in rome for want of linen since when i'll be sworn he wore none but a dishclout of jaquenetta's and that a wears next his heart for a favour enter mercade

god save you madam 

welcome mercade but that thou interrupt'st our merriment 

i am sorry madam for the news i bring is heavy in my tongue the king your father 

dead for my life 

even so my tale is told 

worthies away the scene begins to cloud don

for mine own part i breathe free breath i have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion and i will right myself like a soldier exeunt worthies

how fares your majesty 

boyet prepare i will away tonight 

madam not so i do beseech you stay 

prepare i say i thank you gracious lords for all your fair endeavors and entreat out of a new sad soul that you vouchsafe in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide the liberal opposition of our spirits if over boldly we have borne ourselves in the converse of breath your gentleness was guilty of it farewell worthy lord a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue excuse me so coming too short of thanks for my great suit so easily obtain'd 

the extreme parts of time extremely forms all causes to the purpose of his speed and often at his very loose decides that which long process could not arbitrate and though the mourning brow of progeny forbid the smiling courtesy of love the holy suit which fain it would convince yet since love's argument was first on foot let not the cloud of sorrow justle it from what it purposed since to wail friends lost is not by much so wholesome profitable as to rejoice at friends but newly found 

i understand you not my griefs are double 

honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief and by these badges understand the king for your fair sakes have we neglected time play'd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies hath much deform'd us fashioning our humours even to the opposed end of our intents and what in us hath seem'd ridiculous as love is full of unbefitting strains all wanton as a child skipping and vain form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye full of strange shapes of habits and of forms varying in subjects as the eye doth roll to every varied object in his glance which parti coated presence of loose love put on by us if in your heavenly eyes have misbecomed our oaths and gravities those heavenly eyes that look into these faults suggested us to make therefore ladies our love being yours the error that love makes is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false by being once false for ever to be true to those that make us both fair ladies you and even that falsehood in itself a sin thus purifies itself and turns to grace 

we have received your letters full of love your favours the ambassadors of love and in our maiden council rated them at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy as bombast and as lining to the time but more devout than this in our respects have we not been and therefore met your loves in their own fashion like a merriment 

our letters madam show'd much more than jest 

so did our looks 

we did not quote them so 

now at the latest minute of the hour grant us your loves 

a time methinks too short to make a world without end bargain in no no my lord your grace is perjured much full of dear guiltiness and therefore this if for my love as there is no such cause you will do aught this shall you do for me your oath i will not trust but go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage remote from all the pleasures of the world there stay until the twelve celestial signs have brought about the annual reckoning if this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love but that it bear this trial and last love then at the expiration of the year come challenge me challenge me by these deserts and by this virgin palm now kissing thine i will be thine and till that instant shut my woeful self up in a mourning house raining the tears of lamentation for the remembrance of my father's death if this thou do deny let our hands part neither entitled in the other's heart 

if this or more than this i would deny to flatter up these powers of mine with rest the sudden hand of death close up mine eye hence ever then my heart is in thy breast 

but what to me my love but what to me a wife 

a beard fair health and honesty with three fold love i wish you all these three 

o shall i say i thank you gentle wife 

not so my lord a twelvemonth and a day i'll mark no words that smooth faced wooers say come when the king doth to my lady come then if i have much love i'll give you some 

i'll serve thee true and faithfully till then 

yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again 

what says maria 

at the twelvemonth's end i'll change my black gown for a faithful friend 

i'll stay with patience but the time is long 

the liker you few taller are so young 

studies my lady mistress look on me behold the window of my heart mine eye what humble suit attends thy answer there impose some service on me for thy love 

oft have i heard of you my lord biron before i saw you and the world's large tongue proclaims you for a man replete with mocks full of comparisons and wounding flouts which you on all estates will execute that lie within the mercy of your wit to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain and therewithal to win me if you please without the which i am not to be won you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick and still converse with groaning wretches and your task shall be with all the fierce endeavor of your wit to enforce the pained impotent to smile 

to move wild laughter in the throat of death it cannot be it is impossible mirth cannot move a soul in agony 

why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit whose influence is begot of that loose grace which shallow laughing hearers give to fools a jest's prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it never in the tongue of him that makes it then if sickly ears deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans will hear your idle scorns continue then and i will have you and that fault withal but if they will not throw away that spirit and i shall find you empty of that fault right joyful of your reformation 

a twelvemonth well befall what will befall i'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital 

 to ferdinand ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave 

no madam we will bring you on your way 

our wooing doth not end like an old play jack hath not jill these ladies courtesy might well have made our sport a comedy 

come sir it wants a twelvemonth and a day and then twill end 

that's too long for a play re enter don adriano de armado don

sweet majesty vouchsafe me 

was not that hector 

the worthy knight of troy don

i will kiss thy royal finger and take leave i am a votary i have vowed to jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three years but most esteemed greatness will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo it should have followed in the end of our show 

call them forth quickly we will do so don

holla approach re enter holofernes sir nathaniel moth costard and others this side is hiems winter this ver the spring the one maintained by the owl the other by the cuckoo ver begin the song spring when daisies pied and violets blue and lady smocks all silver white and cuckoo buds of yellow hue do paint the meadows with delight the cuckoo then on every tree mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear unpleasing to a married ear when shepherds pipe on oaten straws and merry larks are ploughmen's clocks when turtles tread and rooks and daws and maidens bleach their summer smocks the cuckoo then on every tree mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear unpleasing to a married ear winter when icicles hang by the wall and dick the shepherd blows his nail and tom bears logs into the hall and milk comes frozen home in pail when blood is nipp'd and ways be foul then nightly sings the staring owl tu whit tu who a merry note while greasy joan doth keel the pot when all aloud the wind doth blow and coughing drowns the parson's saw and birds sit brooding in the snow and marian's nose looks red and raw when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl then nightly sings the staring owl tu whit tu who a merry note while greasy joan doth keel the pot don

the words of mercury are harsh after the songs of apollo you that way we this way
