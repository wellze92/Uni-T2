the first part of king henry the fourth

scene i london the palace 

enter king henry lord john of lancaster the earl of westmoreland sir walter blunt and others

so shaken as we are so wan with care find we a time for frighted peace to pant and breathe short winded accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own children's blood nor more shall trenching war channel her fields nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed eyes which like the meteors of a troubled heaven all of one nature of one substance bred did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now in mutual well beseeming ranks march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance kindred and allies the edge of war like an ill sheathed knife no more shall cut his master therefore friends as far as to the sepulchre of christ whose soldier now under whose blessed cross we are impressed and engaged to fight forthwith a power of english shall we levy whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd for our advantage on the bitter cross but this our purpose now is twelve month old and bootless tis to tell you we will go therefore we meet not now then let me hear of you my gentle cousin westmoreland what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience 

my liege this haste was hot in question and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight when all athwart there came a post from wales loaden with heavy news whose worst was that the noble mortimer leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower was by the rude hands of that welshman taken a thousand of his people butchered upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse such beastly shameless transformation by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of 

it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land 

this match'd with other did my gracious lord for more uneven and unwelcome news came from the north and thus it did import on holy rood day the gallant hotspur there young harry percy and brave archibald that ever valiant and approved scot at holmedon met where they did spend a sad and bloody hour as by discharge of their artillery and shape of likelihood the news was told for he that brought them in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse uncertain of the issue any way 

here is a dear a true industrious friend sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse stain'd with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights balk'd in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedon's plains of prisoners hotspur took mordake the earl of fife and eldest son to beaten douglas and the earl of athol of murray angus and menteith and is not this an honourable spoil a gallant prize ha cousin is it not 

in faith it is a conquest for a prince to boast of 

yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son a son who is the theme of honour's tongue amongst a grove the very straightest plant who is sweet fortune's minion and her pride whilst i by looking on the praise of him see riot and dishonour stain the brow of my young harry o that it could be proved that some night tripping fairy had exchanged in cradle clothes our children where they lay and call'd mine percy his plantagenet then would i have his harry and he mine but let him from my thoughts what think you coz of this young percy's pride the prisoners which he in this adventure hath surprised to his own use he keeps and sends me word i shall have none but mordake earl of fife 

this is his uncle's teaching this is worcester malevolent to you in all aspects which makes him prune himself and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity 

but i have sent for him to answer this and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem cousin on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us again for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be uttered 

i will my liege 

scene ii london an apartment of the prince's 

enter the prince of wales and falstaff

now hal what time of day is it lad 

thou art so fat witted with drinking of old sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping houses and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame coloured taffeta i see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day 

indeed you come near me now hal for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not by phoebus he that wandering knight so fair and i prithee sweet wag when thou art king as god save thy grace majesty i should say for grace thou wilt have none 

what none 

no by my troth not so much as will serve to prologue to an egg and butter 

well how then come roundly roundly 

marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's beauty let us be diana's foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the moon and let men say we be men of good government being governed as the sea is by our noble and chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal 

thou sayest well and it holds well too for the fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea being governed as the sea is by the moon as for proof now a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on monday night and most dissolutely spent on tuesday morning got with swearing lay by and spent with crying bring in now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows 

by the lord thou sayest true lad and is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench 

as the honey of hybla my old lad of the castle and is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance 

how now how now mad wag what in thy quips and thy quiddities what a plague have i to do with a buff jerkin 

why what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern 

well thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft 

did i ever call for thee to pay thy part 

no i'll give thee thy due thou hast paid all there 

yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch and where it would not i have used my credit 

yea and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent but i prithee sweet wag shall there be gallows standing in england when thou art king and resolution thus fobbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law do not thou when thou art king hang a thief 

no thou shalt 

shall i o rare by the lord i'll be a brave judge 

thou judgest false already i mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman 

well hal well and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court i can tell you 

for obtaining of suits 

yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe sblood i am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear 

or an old lion or a lover's lute 

yea or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe 

what sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of moor ditch 

thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most comparative rascalliest sweet young prince but hal i prithee trouble me no more with vanity i would to god thou and i knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought an old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you sir but i marked him not and yet he talked very wisely but i regarded him not and yet he talked wisely and in the street too 

thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it 

o thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint thou hast done much harm upon me hal god forgive thee for it before i knew thee hal i knew nothing and now am i if a man should speak truly little better than one of the wicked i must give over this life and i will give it over by the lord and i do not i am a villain i'll be damned for never a king's son in christendom 

where shall we take a purse tomorrow jack 

'zounds where thou wilt lad i'll make one an i do not call me villain and baffle me 

i see a good amendment of life in thee from praying to purse taking 

why hal tis my vocation hal tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation enter poins poins now shall we know if gadshill have set a match o if men were to be saved by merit what hole in hell were hot enough for him this is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried stand to a true man 

good morrow ned 

good morrow sweet hal what says monsieur remorse what says sir john sack and sugar jack how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on good friday last for a cup of madeira and a cold capon's leg 

sir john stands to his word the devil shall have his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs he will give the devil his due 

then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil 

else he had been damned for cozening the devil 

but my lads my lads to morrow morning by four o'clock early at gadshill there are pilgrims going to canterbury with rich offerings and traders riding to london with fat purses i have vizards for you all you have horses for yourselves gadshill lies to night in rochester i have bespoke supper to morrow night in eastcheap we may do it as secure as sleep if you will go i will stuff your purses full of crowns if you will not tarry at home and be hanged 

hear ye yedward if i tarry at home and go not i'll hang you for going 

you will chops 

hal wilt thou make one 

who i rob i a thief not i by my faith 

there's neither honesty manhood nor good fellowship in thee nor thou camest not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand for ten shillings 

well then once in my days i'll be a madcap 

why that's well said 

well come what will i'll tarry at home 

by the lord i'll be a traitor then when thou art king 

i care not 

sir john i prithee leave the prince and me alone i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go 

well god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believed that the true prince may for recreation sake prove a false thief for the poor abuses of the time want countenance farewell you shall find me in eastcheap 

farewell thou latter spring farewell all hallown summer exit falstaff

now my good sweet honey lord ride with us to morrow i have a jest to execute that i cannot manage alone falstaff bardolph peto and gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid yourself and i will not be there and when they have the booty if you and i do not rob them cut this head off from my shoulders 

how shall we part with them in setting forth 

why we will set forth before or after them and appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves which they shall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them 

yea but tis like that they will know us by our horses by our habits and by every other appointment to be ourselves 

tut our horses they shall not see i'll tie them in the wood our vizards we will change after we leave them and sirrah i have cases of buckram for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments 

yea but i doubt they will be too hard for us 

well for two of them i know them to be as true bred cowards as ever turned back and for the third if he fight longer than he sees reason i'll forswear arms the virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least he fought with what wards what blows what extremities he endured and in the reproof of this lies the jest 

well i'll go with thee provide us all things necessary and meet me to morrow night in eastcheap there i'll sup farewell 

farewell my lord exit poins

i know you all and will awhile uphold the unyoked humour of your idleness yet herein will i imitate the sun who doth permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world that when he please again to be himself being wanted he may be more wonder'd at by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapours that did seem to strangle him if all the year were playing holidays to sport would be as tedious as to work but when they seldom come they wish'd for come and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents so when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised by how much better than my word i am by so much shall i falsify men's hopes and like bright metal on a sullen ground my reformation glittering o'er my fault shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off i'll so offend to make offence a skill redeeming time when men think least i will 


scene iii london the palace 

enter the king northumberland worcester hotspur sir walter blunt with others

my blood hath been too cold and temperate unapt to stir at these indignities and you have found me for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself mighty and to be fear'd than my condition which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud 

our house my sovereign liege little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly 

my lord 

worcester get thee gone for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you exit worcester you were about to speak to north

yea my good lord those prisoners in your highness name demanded which harry percy here at holmedon took were as he says not with such strength denied as is deliver'd to your majesty either envy therefore or misprison is guilty of this fault and not my son 

my liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap'd show'd like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfumed like a milliner and twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and took't away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talk'd and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he call'd them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he question'd me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majesty's behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold to be so pester'd with a popinjay out of my grief and my impatience answer'd neglectingly i know not what he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark and telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth was parmaceti for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villanous salt petre should be digg'd out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answer'd indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty 

the circumstance consider'd good my lord whate'er lord harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place at such a time with all the rest retold may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said so he unsay it now 

why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brother in law the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damn'd glendower whose daughter as we hear the earl of march hath lately married shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home shall we but treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer 

revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn's sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severn's flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank bloodstained with these valiant combatants never did base and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds nor could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slander'd with revolt 

thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you my lord northumberland we licence your departure with your son send us your prisoners or you will hear of it exeunt king henry blunt and train

an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so for i will ease my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head 

what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile here comes your uncle re enter worcester

speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part i'll empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the down trod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and canker'd bolingbroke 

brother the king hath made your nephew mad 

who struck this heat up after i was gone 

he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife's brother then his cheek look'd pale and on my face he turn'd an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer 

i cannot blame him was not he proclaim'd by richard that dead is the next of blood 

he was i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king whose wrongs in us god pardon did set forth upon his irish expedition from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered 

and for whose death we in the world's wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of 

but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown 

he did myself did hear it 

nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wished him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose an plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are fool'd discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banish'd honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say 

peace cousin say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book and to your quick conceiving discontents i'll read you matter deep and dangerous as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to o'er walk a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear 

if he fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honour cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare 

imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience 

by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drowned honour by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this half faced fellowship 

he apprehends a world of figures here but not the form of what he should attend good cousin give me audience for a while 

i cry you mercy 

those same noble scots that are your prisoners 

i'll keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not i'll keep them by this hand 

you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes those prisoners you shall keep 

nay i will that's flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear i'll holla mortimer nay i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion 

hear you cousin a word 

all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same sword and buckler prince of wales but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance i would have him poison'd with a pot of ale 

farewell kinsman i'll talk to you when you are better temper'd to attend 

why what a wasp stung and impatient fool art thou to break into this woman's mood tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own 

why look you i am whipp'd and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richard's time what do you call the place a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bow'd my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke sblood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh 

at berkley castle 

you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me look when his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale i have done 

nay if you have not to it again we will stay your leisure 

i have done i faith 

then once more to your scottish prisoners deliver them up without their ransom straight and make the douglas son your only mean for powers in scotland which for divers reasons which i shall send you written be assured will easily be granted you my lord to northumberland your son in scotland being thus employ'd shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate well beloved the archbishop 

of york is it not 

true who bears hard his brother's death at bristol the lord scroop i speak not this in estimation as what i think might be but what i know is ruminated plotted and set down and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on 

i smell it upon my life it will do well 

before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip 

why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha 

and so they shall 

in faith it is exceedingly well aim'd 

and tis no little reason bids us speed to save our heads by raising of a head for bear ourselves as even as we can the king will always think him in our debt and think we think ourselves unsatisfied till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love 

he does he does we'll be revenged on him 

cousin farewell no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course when time is ripe which will be suddenly i'll steal to glendower and lord mortimer where you and douglas and our powers at once as i will fashion it shall happily meet to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms which now we hold at much uncertainty 

farewell good brother we shall thrive i trust 

uncle adieu o let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport

why he hacked it with his dagger and said he would swear truth out of england but he would make you believe it was done in fight and persuaded us to do the like 

yea and to tickle our noses with spear grass to make them bleed and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men i did that i did not this seven year before i blushed to hear his monstrous devices 

o villain thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago and wert taken with the manner and ever since thou hast blushed extempore thou hadst fire and sword on thy side and yet thou rannest away what instinct hadst thou for it 

my lord do you see these meteors do you behold these exhalations

o horseback ye cuckoo but afoot he will not budge a foot

i grant ye upon instinct well he is there too and one mordake and a thousand blue caps more worcester is stolen away to night thy father's beard is turned white with the news you may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel 

why then it is like if there come a hot june and this civil buffeting hold we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hob nails by the hundreds 

by the mass lad thou sayest true it is like we shall have good trading that way but tell me hal art not thou horrible afeard thou being heir apparent could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend douglas that spirit percy and that devil glendower art thou not horribly afraid doth not thy blood thrill at it 

not a whit i faith i lack some of thy instinct

do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars of my life 

shall i content this chair shall be my state this dagger my sceptre and this cushion my crown 

thy state is taken for a joined stool thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown 

well an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee now shalt thou be moved give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red that it may be thought i have wept for i must speak in passion and i will do it in king cambyses vein 

well here is my leg

hostess

o jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever i see 

peace good pint pot peace good tickle brain harry i do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time but also how thou art accompanied for though the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner it wears that thou art my son i have partly thy mother's word partly my own opinion but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me if then thou be son to me here lies the point why being son to me art thou so pointed at shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries a question not to be asked shall the sun of england prove a thief and take purses a question to be asked there is a thing harry which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth the company thou keepest for harry now i do not speak to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion not in words only but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom i have often noted in thy company but i know not his name 

what manner of man an it like your majesty 

a goodly portly man i faith and a corpulent of a cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as i think his age some fifty or by'r lady inclining to three score and now i remember me his name is falstaff if that man should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for harry i see virtue in his looks if then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then peremptorily i speak it there is virtue in that falstaff him keep with the rest banish and tell me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou been this month 

dost thou speak like a king do thou stand for me and i'll play my father 

depose me if thou dost it half so gravely so majestically both in word and matter hang me up by the heels for a rabbit sucker or a poulter's hare 

well here i am set 

and here i stand judge my masters

'sblood my lord they are false nay i'll tickle ye for a young prince i faith 

swearest thou ungracious boy henceforth ne'er look on me thou art violently carried away from grace there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man a tun of man is thy companion why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that bolting hutch of beastliness that swollen parcel of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed cloak bag of guts that roasted manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in years wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it wherein cunning but in craft wherein crafty but in villany wherein villanous but in all things wherein worthy but in nothing 

i would your grace would take me with you whom means your grace 

that villanous abominable misleader of youth falstaff that old white bearded satan 

my lord the man i know 

i know thou dost 

but to say i know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than i know that he is old the more the pity his white hairs do witness it but that he is saving your reverence a whoremaster that i utterly deny if sack and sugar be a fault god help the wicked if to be old and merry be a sin then many an old host that i know is damned if to be fat be to be hated then pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved no my good lord banish peto banish bardolph banish poins but for sweet jack falstaff kind jack falstaff true jack falstaff valiant jack falstaff and therefore more valiant being as he is old jack falstaff banish not him thy harry's company banish not him thy harry's company banish plump jack and banish all the world

good morrow good my lord 

scene i bangor the archdeacon's house 

enter hotspur worcester mortimer and glendower

these promises are fair the parties sure and our induction full of prosperous hope 

lord mortimer and cousin glendower will you sit down and uncle worcester a plague upon it i have forgot the map 

no here it is sit cousin percy sit good cousin hotspur for by that name as oft as lancaster doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven 

and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of 

i cannot blame him at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes of burning cressets and at my birth the frame and huge foundation of the earth shaked like a coward 

why so it would have done at the same season if your mother's cat had but kittened though yourself had never been born 

i say the earth did shake when i was born 

and i say the earth was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook 

the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble 

o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and moss grown towers at your birth our grandam earth having this distemperature in passion shook 

cousin of many men i do not bear these crossings give me leave to tell you once again that at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes the goats ran from the mountains and the herds were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields these signs have mark'd me extraordinary and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men where is he living clipp'd in with the sea that chides the banks of england scotland wales which calls me pupil or hath read to me and bring him out that is but woman's son can trace me in the tedious ways of art and hold me pace in deep experiments 

i think there's no man speaks better welsh i'll to dinner 

peace cousin percy you will make him mad 

i can call spirits from the vasty deep 

why so can i or so can any man but will they come when you do call for them 

why i can teach you cousin to command the devil 

and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil if thou have power to raise him bring him hither and i'll be sworn i have power to shame him hence o while you live tell truth and shame the devil 

come come no more of this unprofitable chat 

three times hath henry bolingbroke made head against my power thrice from the banks of wye and sandy bottom'd severn have i sent him bootless home and weather beaten back 

home without boots and in foul weather too how scapes he agues in the devil's name 

come here's the map shall we divide our right according to our threefold order ta'en 

the archdeacon hath divided it into three limits very equally england from trent and severn hitherto by south and east is to my part assign'd all westward wales beyond the severn shore and all the fertile land within that bound to owen glendower and dear coz to you the remnant northward lying off from trent and our indentures tripartite are drawn which being sealed interchangeably a business that this night may execute to morrow cousin percy you and i and my good lord of worcester will set forth to meet your father and the scottish power as is appointed us at shrewsbury my father glendower is not ready yet not shall we need his help these fourteen days within that space you may have drawn together your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen 

a shorter time shall send me to you lords and in my conduct shall your ladies come from whom you now must steal and take no leave for there will be a world of water shed upon the parting of your wives and you 

methinks my moiety north from burton here in quantity equals not one of yours see how this river comes me cranking in and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge half moon a monstrous cantle out i'll have the current in this place damm'd up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here 

not wind it shall it must you see it doth 

yea but mark how he bears his course and runs me up with like advantage on the other side gelding the opposed continent as much as on the other side it takes from you 

yea but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land and then he runs straight and even 

i'll have it so a little charge will do it 

i'll not have it alter'd 

will not you 

no nor you shall not 

who shall say me nay 

why that will i 

let me not understand you then speak it in welsh 

i can speak english lord as well as you for i was train'd up in the english court where being but young i framed to the harp many an english ditty lovely well and gave the tongue a helpful ornament a virtue that was never seen in you 

marry and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same metre ballad mongers i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd or a dry wheel grate on the axle tree and that would set my teeth nothing on edge nothing so much as mincing poetry tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag 

come you shall have trent turn'd 

i do not care i'll give thrice so much land to any well deserving friend but in the way of bargain mark ye me i'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair are the indentures drawn shall we be gone 

the moon shines fair you may away by night i'll haste the writer and withal break with your wives of your departure hence i am afraid my daughter will run mad so much she doteth on her mortimer exit glendower

fie cousin percy how you cross my father 

i cannot choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a clip wing'd griffin and a moulten raven a couching lion and a ramping cat and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff as puts me from my faith i tell you what he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils names that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to but mark'd him not a word o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summer house in christendom 

in faith he is a worthy gentleman exceedingly well read and profited in strange concealments valiant as a lion and as wondrous affable and as bountiful as mines of india shall i tell you cousin he holds your temper in a high respect and curbs himself even of his natural scope when you come cross his humour faith he does i warrant you that man is not alive might so have tempted him as you have done without the taste of danger and reproof but do not use it oft let me entreat you 

in faith my lord you are too wilful blame and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite beside his patience you must needs learn lord to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness courage blood and that's the dearest grace it renders you yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage defect of manners want of government pride haughtiness opinion and disdain the least of which haunting a nobleman loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain upon the beauty of all parts besides beguiling them of commendation 

well i am school'd good manners be your speed here come our wives and let us take our leave re enter glendower with the ladies

this is the deadly spite that angers me my wife can speak no english i no welsh 

my daughter weeps she will not part with you she'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars 

good father tell her that she and my aunt percy shall follow in your conduct speedily glendower speaks to her in welsh and she answers him in the same

she is desperate here a peevish self wind harlotry one that no persuasion can do good upon the lady speaks in welsh

i understand thy looks that pretty welsh which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens i am too perfect in and but for shame in such a parley should i answer thee the lady speaks again in welsh i understand thy kisses and thou mine and that's a feeling disputation but i will never be a truant love till i have learned thy language for thy tongue makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower with ravishing division to her lute 

nay if you melt then will she run mad the lady speaks again in welsh

o i am ignorance itself in this 

she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down and rest your gentle head upon her lap and she will sing the song that pleaseth you and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep charming your blood with pleasing heaviness making such difference twixt wake and sleep as is the difference betwixt day and night the hour before the heavenly harness'd team begins his golden progress in the east 

with all my heart i'll sit and hear her sing by that time will our book i think be drawn

do so and those musicians that shall play to you hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence and straight they shall be here sit and attend 

come kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap 

go ye giddy goose the music plays

now i perceive the devil understands welsh and tis no marvel he is so humorous by'r lady he is a good musician 

then should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours lie still ye thief and hear the lady sing in welsh 

i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish 

wouldst thou have thy head broken 

no 

then be still 

neither tis a woman's fault 

now god help thee 

to the welsh lady's bed 

what's that 

peace she sings here the lady sings a welsh song

come kate i'll have your song too 

not mine in good sooth 

not yours in good sooth heart you swear like a comfit maker's wife not you in good sooth and as true as i live and as god shall mend me and as sure as day and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths as if thou never walk'st further than finsbury swear me kate like a lady as thou art a good mouth filling oath and leave in sooth and such protest of pepper gingerbread to velvet guards and sunday citizens come sing 

i will not sing 

'tis the next way to turn tailor or be red breast teacher an the indentures be drawn i'll away within these two hours and so come in when ye will 

come come lord mortimer you are as slow as hot lord percy is on fire to go by this our book is drawn we'll but seal and then to horse immediately 

with all my heart 

scene ii london the palace 

enter king henry iv prince henry and others

lords give us leave the prince of wales and i must have some private conference but be near at hand for we shall presently have need of you exeunt lords i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only mark'd for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art match'd withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart 

so please your majesty i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg as in reproof of many tales devised which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear by smiling pick thanks and base news mongers i may for some things true wherein my youth hath faulty wander'd and irregular find pardon on my true submission 

god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruin'd and the soul of every man prophetically doth forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so common hackney'd in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wonder'd at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dress'd myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men's hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical ne'er seen but wonder'd at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with capering fools had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoff'd himself to popularity that being daily swallow'd by men's eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sun like majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and render'd such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou has lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is a weary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness 

i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord be more myself 

for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now now by my sceptre and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor colour like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lion's armed jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what never dying honour hath he got against renowned douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathling clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas ta'en him once enlarged him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumberland the archbishop's grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell these news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my near'st and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percy's pay to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns to show how much thou art degenerate 

do not think so you shall not find it so and god forgive them that so much have sway'd your majesty's good thoughts away from me i will redeem all this on percy's head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favours in a bloody mask which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day whene'er it lights that this same child of honour and renown this gallant hotspur this all praised knight and your unthought of harry chance to meet for every honour sitting on his helm would they were multitudes and on my head my shames redoubled for the time will come that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf and i will call him to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the slightest worship of his time or i will tear the reckoning from his heart this in the name of god i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform i do beseech your majesty may salve the long grown wounds of my intemperance if not the end of life cancels all bands and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow 

a hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein enter blunt how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed 

so hath the business that i come to speak of lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word that douglas and the english rebels met the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury a mighty and a fearful head they are if promises be kept on every hand as ever offer'd foul play in the state 

the earl of westmoreland set forth to day with him my son lord john of lancaster for this advertisement is five days old on wednesday next harry you shall set forward on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting is bridgenorth and harry you shall march through gloucestershire by which account our business valued some twelve days hence our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet our hands are full of business let's away advantage feeds him fat while men delay

rare words brave world hostess my breakfast come o i could wish this tavern were my drum 

scene i the rebel camp near shrewsbury 

enter hotspur worcester and douglas

well said my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery such attribution should the douglas have as not a soldier of this season's stamp should go so general current through the world by god i cannot flatter i do defy the tongues of soothers but a braver place in my heart's love hath no man than yourself nay task me to my word approve me lord 

thou art the king of honour no man so potent breathes upon the ground but i will beard him 

do so and tis well enter a messenger with letters what letters hast thou there i can but thank you 

messenger

these letters come from your father 

letters from him why comes he not himself 

messenger

he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick 

'zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a rustling time who leads his power under whose government come they along 

messenger

his letters bear his mind not i my lord 

i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed 

messenger

he did my lord four days ere i set forth and at the time of my departure thence he was much fear'd by his physicians 

i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited his health was never better worth than now 

sick now droop now this sickness doth infect the very life blood of our enterprise tis catching hither even to our camp he writes me here that inward sickness and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possess'd of all our purposes what say you to it 

your father's sickness is a maim to us 

a perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off and yet in faith it is not his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour it were not good for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope the very list the very utmost bound of all our fortunes 

'faith and so we should where now remains a sweet reversion we may boldly spend upon the hope of what is to come in a comfort of retirement lives in this 

a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs 

but yet i would your father had been here the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division it will be thought by some that know not why he is away that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause for well you know we of the offering side must keep aloof from strict arbitrement and stop all sight holes every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us this absence of your father's draws a curtain that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of 

you strain too far i rather of his absence make this use it lends a lustre and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom with his help we shall o'erturn it topsy turvy down yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole 

as heart can think there is not such a word spoke of in scotland as this term of fear enter sir richard vernon

my cousin vernon welcome by my soul 

pray god my news be worth a welcome lord the earl of westmoreland seven thousand strong is marching hitherwards with him prince john 

no harm what more 

and further i have learn'd the king himself in person is set forth or hitherwards intended speedily with strong and mighty preparation 

he shall be welcome too where is his son the nimble footed madcap prince of wales and his comrades that daff'd the world aside and bid it pass 

all furnish'd all in arms all plumed like estridges that with the wind baited like eagles having lately bathed glittering in golden coats like images as full of spirit as the month of may and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls i saw young harry with his beaver on his cuisses on his thighs gallantly arm'd rise from the ground like feather'd mercury and vaulted with such ease into his seat as if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds to turn and wind a fiery pegasus and witch the world with noble horsemanship 

no more no more worse than the sun in march this praise doth nourish agues let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim and to the fire eyed maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mailed mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours come let me taste my horse who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall hot horse to horse meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse o that glendower were come 

there is more news i learn'd in worcester as i rode along he cannot draw his power this fourteen days 

that's the worst tidings that i hear of yet 

ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound 

what may the king's whole battle reach unto 

to thirty thousand 

forty let it be my father and glendower being both away the powers of us may serve so great a day come let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near die all die merrily

tut tut good enough to toss food for powder food for powder they'll fill a pit as well as better tush man mortal men mortal men 

ay but sir john methinks they are exceeding poor and bare too beggarly 

'faith for their poverty i know not where they had that and for their bareness i am sure they never learned that of me 

no i'll be sworn unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare but sirrah make haste percy is already in the field 

what is the king encamped 

he is sir john i fear we shall stay too long 

well to the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast fits a dull fighter and a keen guest 

scene iii the rebel camp near shrewsbury 

enter hotspur worcester douglas and vernon

we'll fight with him to night 

it may not be 

you give him then the advantage 

not a whit 

why say you so looks he not for supply 

so do we 

his is certain ours is doubtful 

good cousin be advised stir not tonight 

do not my lord 

you do not counsel well you speak it out of fear and cold heart 

do me no slander douglas by my life and i dare well maintain it with my life if well respected honour bid me on i hold as little counsel with weak fear as you my lord or any scot that this day lives let it be seen to morrow in the battle which of us fears 

yea or to night 

content 

to night say i 

come come it nay not be i wonder much being men of such great leading as you are that you foresee not what impediments drag back our expedition certain horse of my cousin vernon's are not yet come up your uncle worcester's horse came but today and now their pride and mettle is asleep their courage with hard labour tame and dull that not a horse is half the half of himself 

so are the horses of the enemy in general journey bated and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest 

the number of the king exceedeth ours for god's sake cousin stay till all come in the trumpet sounds a parley enter sir walter blunt

i come with gracious offers from the king if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect 

welcome sir walter blunt and would to god you were of our determination some of us love you well and even those some envy your great deservings and good name because you are not of our quality but stand against us like an enemy 

and god defend but still i should stand so so long as out of limit and true rule you stand against anointed majesty but to my charge the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot which he confesseth to be manifold he bids you name your griefs and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion 

the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the world's regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocency and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and perform'd it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths gave him their heirs as pages follow'd him even at the heels in golden multitudes he presently as greatness knows itself steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father while his blood was poor upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh and now forsooth takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth cries out upon abuses seems to weep over his country's wrongs and by this face this seeming brow of justice did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for proceeded further cut me off the heads of all the favourites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here when he was personal in the irish war 

tut i came not to hear this 

then to the point in short time after he deposed the king soon after that deprived him of his life and in the neck of that task'd the whole state to make that worse suffer'd his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placed indeed his king to be engaged in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgraced me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligence rated mine uncle from the council board in rage dismiss'd my father from the court broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which we find too indirect for long continuance 

shall i return this answer to the king 

not so sir walter we'll withdraw awhile go to the king and let there be impawn'd some surety for a safe return again and in the morning early shall my uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell 

i would you would accept of grace and love 

and may be so we shall 

pray god you do

hie good sir michael bear this sealed brief with winged haste to the lord marshal this to my cousin scroop and all the rest to whom they are directed if you knew how much they do to import you would make haste 

my good lord i guess their tenor 

like enough you do to morrow good sir michael is a day wherein the fortune of ten thousand men must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury as i am truly given to understand the king with mighty and quick raised power meets with lord harry and i fear sir michael what with the sickness of northumberland whose power was in the first proportion and what with owen glendower's absence thence who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in o'er ruled by prophecies i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king 

why my good lord you need not fear there is douglas and lord mortimer 

no mortimer is not there 

but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors noble gentlemen 

and so there is but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales lord john of lancaster the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt and moe corrivals and dear men of estimation and command in arms 

doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed 

i hope no less yet needful tis to fear and to prevent the worst sir michael speed for if lord percy thrive not ere the king dismiss his power he means to visit us for he hath heard of our confederacy and tis but wisdom to make strong against him therefore make haste i must go write again to other friends and so farewell sir michael 

scene i king henry iv's camp near shrewsbury 

enter king henry prince henry lord john of lancaster earl of westmoreland sir walter blunt and falstaff

how bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon busky hill the day looks pale at his distemperature 

the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blustering day 

then with the losers let it sympathize for nothing can seem foul to those that win the trumpet sounds enter worcester and vernon how now my lord of worcester tis not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet you have deceived our trust and made us doff our easy robes of peace to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel this is not well my lord this is not well what say you to it will you again unknit this curlish knot of all abhorred war and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light and be no more an exhaled meteor a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times 

hear me my liege for mine own part i could be well content to entertain the lag end of my life with quiet hours for i do protest i have not sought the day of this dislike 

you have not sought it how comes it then 

rebellion lay in his way and he found it 

peace chewet peace 

it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favour from myself and all our house and yet i must remember you my lord we were the first and dearest of your friends for you my staff of office did i break in richard's time and posted day and night to meet you on the way and kiss your hand when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i it was myself my brother and his son that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time you swore to us and you did swear that oath at doncaster that you did nothing purpose gainst the state nor claim no further than your new fall'n right the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster to this we swore our aid but in short space it rain'd down fortune showering on your head and such a flood of greatness fell on you what with our help what with the absent king what with the injuries of a wanton time the seeming sufferances that you had borne and the contrarious winds that held the king so long in his unlucky irish wars that all in england did repute him dead and from this swarm of fair advantages you took occasion to be quickly woo'd to gripe the general sway into your hand forget your oath to us at doncaster and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle hull the cuckoo's bird useth the sparrow did oppress our nest grew by our feeding to so great a bulk that even our love durst not come near your sight for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing we were enforced for safety sake to fly out of sight and raise this present head whereby we stand opposed by such means as you yourself have forged against yourself by unkind usage dangerous countenance and violation of all faith and troth sworn to us in your younger enterprise 

these things indeed you have articulate proclaim'd at market crosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such water colours to impaint his cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion 

in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter if once they join in trial tell your nephew the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes this present enterprise set off his head i do not think a braver gentleman more active valiant or more valiant young more daring or more bold is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds for my part i may speak it to my shame i have a truant been to chivalry and so i hear he doth account me too yet this before my father's majesty i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation and will to save the blood on either side try fortune with him in a single fight 

and prince of wales so dare we venture thee albeit considerations infinite do make against it no good worcester no we love our people well even those we love that are misled upon your cousin's part and will they take the offer of our grace both he and they and you every man shall be my friend again and i'll be his so tell your cousin and bring me word what he will do but if he will not yield rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office so be gone we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair take it advisedly exeunt worcester and vernon

it will not be accepted on my life the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms 

hence therefore every leader to his charge for on their answer will we set on them and god befriend us as our cause is just exeunt all but prince henry and falstaff

hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so tis a point of friendship 

nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship say thy prayers and farewell 

i would twere bed time hal and all well 

why thou owest god a death exit prince henry

'tis not due yet i would be loath to pay him before his day what need i be so forward with him that calls not on me well tis no matter honour pricks me on yea but how if honour prick me off when i come on how then can honour set to a leg no or an arm no or take away the grief of a wound no honour hath no skill in surgery then no what is honour a word what is in that word honour what is that honour air a trim reckoning who hath it he that died o wednesday doth he feel it no doth he hear it no tis insensible then yea to the dead but will it not live with the living no why detraction will not suffer it therefore i'll none of it honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism 

scene ii the rebel camp 

enter worcester and vernon

o no my nephew must not know sir richard the liberal and kind offer of the king 

'twere best he did 

then are we all undone it is not possible it cannot be the king should keep his word in loving us he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offence in other faults suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes for treason is but trusted like the fox who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up will have a wild trick of his ancestors look how we can or sad or merrily interpretation will misquote our looks and we shall feed like oxen at a stall the better cherish'd still the nearer death my nephew's trespass may be well forgot it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood and an adopted name of privilege a hair brain'd hotspur govern'd by a spleen all his offences live upon my head and on his father's we did train him on and his corruption being ta'en from us we as the spring of all shall pay for all therefore good cousin let not harry know in any case the offer of the king 

deliver what you will i'll say tis so here comes your cousin enter hotspur and douglas

my uncle is return'd deliver up my lord of westmoreland uncle what news 

the king will bid you battle presently 

defy him by the lord of westmoreland 

lord douglas go you and tell him so 

marry and shall and very willingly 

there is no seeming mercy in the king 

did you beg any god forbid 

i told him gently of our grievances of his oath breaking which he mended thus by now forswearing that he is forsworn he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us re enter the earl of douglas

arm gentlemen to arms for i have thrown a brave defiance in king henry's teeth and westmoreland that was engaged did bear it which cannot choose but bring him quickly on 

the prince of wales stepp'd forth before the king and nephew challenged you to single fight 

o would the quarrel lay upon our heads and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me how show'd his tasking seem'd it in contempt 

no by my soul i never in my life did hear a challenge urged more modestly unless a brother should a brother dare to gentle exercise and proof of arms he gave you all the duties of a man trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue spoke to your deservings like a chronicle making you ever better than his praise by still dispraising praise valued in you and which became him like a prince indeed he made a blushing cital of himself and chid his truant youth with such a grace as if he master'd there a double spirit of teaching and of learning instantly there did he pause but let me tell the world if he outlive the envy of this day england did never owe so sweet a hope so much misconstrued in his wantonness 

cousin i think thou art enamoured on his follies never did i hear of any prince so wild a libertine but be he as he will yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldier's arm that he shall shrink under my courtesy arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends better consider what you have to do than i that have not well the gift of tongue can lift your blood up with persuasion enter a messenger

by god thou hast deceived me lancaster i did not think thee lord of such a spirit before i loved thee as a brother john but now i do respect thee as my soul

o this boy lends mettle to us all enter douglas

another king they grow like hydra's heads i am the douglas fatal to all those that wear those colours on them what art thou that counterfeit'st the person of a king 

the king himself who douglas grieves at heart so many of his shadows thou hast met and not the very king i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily i will assay thee so defend thyself 

i fear thou art another counterfeit and yet in faith thou bear'st thee like a king but mine i am sure thou art whoe'er thou be and thus i win thee they fight king henry being in danger prince henry enters

hold up thy head vile scot or thou art like never to hold it up again the spirits of valiant shirley stafford blunt are in my arms it is the prince of wales that threatens thee who never promiseth but he means to pay they fight douglas flies cheerly my lord how fares your grace sir nicholas gawsey hath for succor sent and so hath clifton i'll to clifton straight 

stay and breathe awhile thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion and show'd thou makest some tender of my life in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me 

o god they did me too much injury that ever said i hearken'd for your death if it were so i might have let alone the insulting hand of douglas over you which would have been as speedy in your end as all the poisonous potions in the world and saved the treacherous labour of your son 

make up to clifton i'll to sir nicholas gawsey enter hotspur

if i mistake not thou art harry monmouth 

thou speak'st as if i would deny my name 

my name is harry percy 

why then i see a very valiant rebel of the name i am the prince of wales and think not percy to share with me in glory any more two stars keep not their motion in one sphere nor can one england brook a double reign of harry percy and the prince of wales 

nor shall it harry for the hour is come to end the one of us and would to god thy name in arms were now as great as mine 

i'll make it greater ere i part from thee and all the budding honours on thy crest i'll crop to make a garland for my head 

i can no longer brook thy vanities they fight enter falstaff

well said hal to it hal nay you shall find no boy's play here i can tell you re enter douglas he fights with falstaff who falls down as if he were dead and exit douglas hotspur is wounded and falls

o harry thou hast robb'd me of my youth i better brook the loss of brittle life than those proud titles thou hast won of me they wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh but thought's the slave of life and life time's fool and time that takes survey of all the world must have a stop o i could prophesy but that the earthy and cold hand of death lies on my tongue no percy thou art dust and food for dies

for worms brave percy fare thee well great heart ill weaved ambition how much art thou shrunk when that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough this earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so stout a gentleman if thou wert sensible of courtesy i should not make so dear a show of zeal but let my favours hide thy mangled face and even in thy behalf i'll thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave but not remember'd in thy epitaph he spieth falstaff on the ground what old acquaintance could not all this flesh keep in a little life poor jack farewell i could have better spared a better man o i should have a heavy miss of thee if i were much in love with vanity death hath not struck so fat a deer to day though many dearer in this bloody fray embowell'd will i see thee by and by till then in blood by noble percy lie exit prince henry

 rising up embowelled if thou embowel me to day i'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too to morrow sblood twas time to counterfeit or that hot termagant scot had paid me scot and lot too counterfeit i lie i am no counterfeit to die is to be a counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed the better part of valour is discretion in the which better part i have saved my life zounds i am afraid of this gunpowder percy though he be dead how if he should counterfeit too and rise by my faith i am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit therefore i'll make him sure yea and i'll swear i killed him why may not he rise as well as i nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me therefore sirrah stabbing him with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me takes up hotspur on his back re enter prince henry and lord john of lancaster

come brother john full bravely hast thou flesh'd thy maiden sword 

but soft whom have we here did you not tell me this fat man was dead 

i did i saw him dead breathless and bleeding on the ground art thou alive or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight i prithee speak we will not trust our eyes without our ears thou art not what thou seem'st 

no that's certain i am not a double man but if i be not jack falstaff then am i a jack there is percy throwing the body down if your father will do me any honour so if not let him kill the next percy himself i look to be either earl or duke i can assure you 

why percy i killed myself and saw thee dead 

didst thou lord lord how this world is given to lying i grant you i was down and out of breath and so was he but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock if i may be believed so if not let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads i'll take it upon my death i gave him this wound in the thigh if the man were alive and would deny it zounds i would make him eat a piece of my sword 

this is the strangest tale that ever i heard 

this is the strangest fellow brother john come bring your luggage nobly on your back for my part if a lie may do thee grace i'll gild it with the happiest terms i have a retreat is sounded the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours come brother let us to the highest of the field to see what friends are living who are dead exeunt prince henry and lancaster

i'll follow as they say for reward he that rewards me god reward him if i do grow great i'll grow less for i'll purge and leave sack and live cleanly as a nobleman should do 

scene v another part of the field 

the trumpets sound enter king henry iv prince henry lord john lancaster earl of westmoreland with worcester and vernon prisoners

thus ever did rebellion find rebuke ill spirited worcester did not we send grace pardon and terms of love to all of you and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust three knights upon our party slain to day a noble earl and many a creature else had been alive this hour if like a christian thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies true intelligence 

what i have done my safety urged me to and i embrace this fortune patiently since not to be avoided it falls on me 

bear worcester to the death and vernon too other offenders we will pause upon exeunt worcester and vernon guarded how goes the field 

the noble scot lord douglas when he saw the fortune of the day quite turn'd from him the noble percy slain and all his men upon the foot of fear fled with the rest and falling from a hill he was so bruised that the pursuers took him at my tent the douglas is and i beseech your grace i may dispose of him 

with all my heart 

then brother john of lancaster to you this honourable bounty shall belong go to the douglas and deliver him up to his pleasure ransomless and free his valour shown upon our crests to day hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds even in the bosom of our adversaries 

i thank your grace for this high courtesy which i shall give away immediately 

then this remains that we divide our power you son john and my cousin westmoreland towards york shall bend you with your dearest speed to meet northumberland and the prelate scroop who as we hear are busily in arms myself and you son harry will towards wales to fight with glendower and the earl of march rebellion in this land shall lose his sway meeting the cheque of such another day and since this business so fair is done let us not leave till all our own be won
