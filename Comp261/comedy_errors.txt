the comedy of errors

scene i a hall in duke solinus's palace 

enter duke solinus aegeon gaoler officers and other attendants

proceed solinus to procure my fall and by the doom of death end woes and all 

merchant of syracuse plead no more i am not partial to infringe our laws the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants our well dealing countrymen who wanting guilders to redeem their lives have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods excludes all pity from our threatening looks for since the mortal and intestine jars twixt thy seditious countrymen and us it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs again if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus he dies his goods confiscate to the duke's dispose unless a thousand marks be levied to quit the penalty and to ransom him thy substance valued at the highest rate cannot amount unto a hundred marks therefore by law thou art condemned to die 

yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the evening sun 

well syracusian say in brief the cause why thou departed'st from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus 

a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offence i'll utter what my sorrows give me leave in syracusa was i born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i lived in joy our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factor's death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguish'd but by names that very hour and in the self same inn a meaner woman was delivered of such a burden male twins both alike those for their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamnum had we sail'd before the always wind obeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embraced yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear forced me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinking ripe to us my wife more careful for the latter born had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispersed those vapours that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas wax'd calm and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they came o let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before 

nay forward old man do not break off so for we may pity though not pardon thee 

o had the gods done so i had not now worthily term'd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encounterd by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seized on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolong'd to tell sad stories of my own mishaps 

and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befall'n of them and thee till now 

my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendant so his case was like reft of his brother but retain'd his name might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i labour'd of a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i loved five summers have i spent in furthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men but here must end the story of my life and happy were i in my timely death could all my travels warrant me they live 

hapless aegeon whom the fates have mark'd to bear the extremity of dire mishap now trust me were it not against our laws against my crown my oath my dignity which princes would they may not disannul my soul would sue as advocate for thee but though thou art adjudged to the death and passed sentence may not be recall'd but to our honour's great disparagement yet i will favour thee in what i can therefore merchant i'll limit thee this day to seek thy life by beneficial help try all the friends thou hast in ephesus beg thou or borrow to make up the sum and live if no then thou art doom'd to die gaoler take him to thy custody 

gaoler

i will my lord 

hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend but to procrastinate his lifeless end

many a man would take you at your word and go indeed having so good a mean antipholus

a trusty villain sir that very oft when i am dull with care and melancholy lightens my humour with his merry jests what will you walk with me about the town and then go to my inn and dine with me 

first merchant

i am invited sir to certain merchants of whom i hope to make much benefit i crave your pardon soon at five o'clock please you i'll meet with you upon the mart and afterward consort you till bed time my present business calls me from you now antipholus

farewell till then i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city 

first merchant

sir i commend you to your own content antipholus

he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i cannot get i to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop who falling there to find his fellow forth unseen inquisitive confounds himself so i to find a mother and a brother in quest of them unhappy lose myself enter dromio of ephesus here comes the almanac of my true date what now how chance thou art return'd so soon 

return'd so soon rather approach'd too late the capon burns the pig falls from the spit the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell my mistress made it one upon my cheek she is so hot because the meat is cold the meat is cold because you come not home you come not home because you have no stomach you have no stomach having broke your fast but we that know what tis to fast and pray are penitent for your default to day antipholus

stop in your wind sir tell me this i pray where have you left the money that i gave you 

o sixpence that i had o wednesday last to pay the saddler for my mistress crupper the saddler had it sir i kept it not antipholus

i am not in a sportive humour now tell me and dally not where is the money we being strangers here how darest thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody 

i pray you air as you sit at dinner i from my mistress come to you in post if i return i shall be post indeed for she will score your fault upon my pate methinks your maw like mine should be your clock and strike you home without a messenger antipholus

come dromio come these jests are out of season reserve them till a merrier hour than this where is the gold i gave in charge to thee 

to me sir why you gave no gold to me antipholus

come on sir knave have done your foolishness and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge 

my charge was but to fetch you from the mart home to your house the phoenix sir to dinner my mistress and her sister stays for you antipholus

in what safe place you have bestow'd my money or i shall break that merry sconce of yours that stands on tricks when i am undisposed where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me 

i have some marks of yours upon my pate some of my mistress marks upon my shoulders but not a thousand marks between you both if i should pay your worship those again perchance you will not bear them patiently antipholus

thy mistress marks what mistress slave hast thou 

your worship's wife my mistress at the phoenix she that doth fast till you come home to dinner and prays that you will hie you home to dinner antipholus

what wilt thou flout me thus unto my face being forbid there take you that sir knave 

what mean you sir for god's sake hold your hands nay and you will not sir i'll take my heels antipholus

upon my life by some device or other the villain is o'er raught of all my money they say this town is full of cozenage as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye dark working sorcerers that change the mind soul killing witches that deform the body disguised cheaters prating mountebanks and many such like liberties of sin if it prove so i will be gone the sooner i'll to the centaur to go seek this slave i greatly fear my money is not safe 

scene i the house of antipholus of ephesus 

enter adriana and luciana

neither my husband nor the slave return'd that in such haste i sent to seek his master sure luciana it is two o'clock 

perhaps some merchant hath invited him and from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner good sister let us dine and never fret a man is master of his liberty time is their master and when they see time they'll go or come if so be patient sister 

why should their liberty than ours be more 

because their business still lies out o door 

look when i serve him so he takes it ill 

o know he is the bridle of your will 

there's none but asses will be bridled so 

why headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe there's nothing situate under heaven's eye but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls are their males subjects and at their controls men more divine the masters of all these lords of the wide world and wild watery seas indued with intellectual sense and souls of more preeminence than fish and fowls are masters to their females and their lords then let your will attend on their accords 

this servitude makes you to keep unwed 

not this but troubles of the marriage bed 

but were you wedded you would bear some sway 

ere i learn love i'll practise to obey 

how if your husband start some other where 

till he come home again i would forbear 

patience unmoved no marvel though she pause they can be meek that have no other cause a wretched soul bruised with adversity we bid be quiet when we hear it cry but were we burdened with like weight of pain as much or more would we ourselves complain so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me but if thou live to see like right bereft this fool begg'd patience in thee will be left 

well i will marry one day but to try here comes your man now is your husband nigh enter dromio of ephesus

say is your tardy master now at hand 

nay he's at two hands with me and that my two ears can witness 

say didst thou speak with him know'st thou his mind 

ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear beshrew his hand i scarce could understand it 

spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning 

nay he struck so plainly i could too well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce understand them 

but say i prithee is he coming home it seems he hath great care to please his wife 

why mistress sure my master is horn mad 

horn mad thou villain 

i mean not cuckold mad but sure he is stark mad when i desired him to come home to dinner he ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold 'tis dinner time quoth i my gold quoth he your meat doth burn quoth i my gold quoth he will you come home quoth i my gold quoth he where is the thousand marks i gave thee villain the pig quoth i is burn'd my gold quoth he my mistress sir quoth i hang up thy mistress i know not thy mistress out on thy mistress 

quoth who 

quoth my master i know quoth he no house no wife no mistress so that my errand due unto my tongue i thank him i bare home upon my shoulders for in conclusion he did beat me there 

go back again thou slave and fetch him home 

go back again and be new beaten home for god's sake send some other messenger 

back slave or i will break thy pate across 

and he will bless that cross with other beating between you i shall have a holy head 

hence prating peasant fetch thy master home 

am i so round with you as you with me that like a football you do spurn me thus you spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither if i last in this service you must case me in leather 

fie how impatience loureth in your face 

his company must do his minions grace whilst i at home starve for a merry look hath homely age the alluring beauty took from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it are my discourses dull barren my wit if voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd unkindness blunts it more than marble hard do their gay vestments his affections bait that's not my fault he's master of my state what ruins are in me that can be found by him not ruin'd then is he the ground of my defeatures my decayed fair a sunny look of his would soon repair but too unruly deer he breaks the pale and feeds from home poor i am but his stale 

self harming jealousy fie beat it hence 

unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense i know his eye doth homage otherwhere or else what lets it but he would be here sister you know he promised me a chain would that alone alone he would detain so he would keep fair quarter with his bed i see the jewel best enamelled will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still that others touch and often touching will wear gold and no man that hath a name by falsehood and corruption doth it shame since that my beauty cannot please his eye i'll weep what's left away and weeping die 

how many fond fools serve mad jealousy 

scene ii a public place 

enter antipholus of syracuse

of syracuse

the gold i gave to dromio is laid up safe at the centaur and the heedful slave is wander'd forth in care to seek me out by computation and mine host's report i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart see here he comes enter dromio of syracuse how now sir is your merry humour alter'd as you love strokes so jest with me again you know no centaur you received no gold your mistress sent to have me home to dinner my house was at the phoenix wast thou mad that thus so madly thou didst answer me 

what answer sir when spake i such a word antipholus

even now even here not half an hour since 

i did not see you since you sent me hence home to the centaur with the gold you gave me antipholus

villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt and told'st me of a mistress and a dinner for which i hope thou felt'st i was displeased 

i am glad to see you in this merry vein what means this jest i pray you master tell me antipholus

yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth think'st thou i jest hold take thou that and that beating him

hold sir for god's sake now your jest is earnest upon what bargain do you give it me antipholus

because that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport but creep in crannies when he hides his beams if you will jest with me know my aspect and fashion your demeanor to my looks or i will beat this method in your sconce 

sconce call you it so you would leave battering i had rather have it a head an you use these blows long i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders but i pray sir why am i beaten antipholus

dost thou not know 

nothing sir but that i am beaten antipholus

shall i tell you why 

ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath a wherefore antipholus

why first for flouting me and then wherefore for urging it the second time to me 

was there ever any man thus beaten out of season when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason well sir i thank you antipholus

thank me sir for what 

marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing antipholus

i'll make you amends next to give you nothing for something but say sir is it dinner time 

no sir i think the meat wants that i have antipholus

in good time sir what's that 

basting antipholus

well sir then twill be dry 

if it be sir i pray you eat none of it antipholus

your reason 

lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting antipholus

well sir learn to jest in good time there's a time for all things 

i durst have denied that before you were so choleric antipholus

by what rule sir 

marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself antipholus

let's hear it 

there's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature antipholus

may he not do it by fine and recovery 

yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man antipholus

why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement 

because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit antipholus

why but there's many a man hath more hair than wit 

not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair antipholus

why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit 

the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity antipholus

for what reason 

for two and sound ones too antipholus

nay not sound i pray you 

sure ones then antipholus

nay not sure in a thing falsing 

certain ones then antipholus

name them 

the one to save the money that he spends in trimming the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge antipholus

you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things 

marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair lost by nature antipholus

but your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover 

thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers antipholus

i knew twould be a bald conclusion but soft who wafts us yonder enter adriana and luciana

ay ay antipholus look strange and frown some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects i am not adriana nor thy wife the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear that never object pleasing in thine eye that never touch well welcome to thy hand that never meat sweet savor'd in thy taste unless i spake or look'd or touch'd or carved to thee how comes it now my husband o how comes it that thou art thus estranged from thyself thyself i call it being strange to me that undividable incorporate am better than thy dear self's better part ah do not tear away thyself from me for know my love as easy mayest thou fall a drop of water in the breaking gulf and take unmingled that same drop again without addition or diminishing as take from me thyself and not me too how dearly would it touch me to the quick shouldst thou but hear i were licentious and that this body consecrate to thee by ruffian lust should be contaminate wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me and hurl the name of husband in my face and tear the stain'd skin off my harlot brow and from my false hand cut the wedding ring and break it with a deep divorcing vow i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it i am possess'd with an adulterate blot my blood is mingled with the crime of lust for if we too be one and thou play false i do digest the poison of thy flesh being strumpeted by thy contagion keep then far league and truce with thy true bed i live unstain'd thou undishonoured antipholus

plead you to me fair dame i know you not in ephesus i am but two hours old as strange unto your town as to your talk who every word by all my wit being scann'd want wit in all one word to understand 

fie brother how the world is changed with you when were you wont to use my sister thus she sent for you by dromio home to dinner antipholus

by dromio 

by me 

by thee and this thou didst return from him that he did buffet thee and in his blows denied my house for his me for his wife antipholus

did you converse sir with this gentlewoman what is the course and drift of your compact 

i sir i never saw her till this time antipholus

villain thou liest for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart 

i never spake with her in all my life antipholus

how can she thus then call us by our names unless it be by inspiration 

how ill agrees it with your gravity to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave abetting him to thwart me in my mood be it my wrong you are from me exempt but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine thou art an elm my husband i a vine whose weakness married to thy stronger state makes me with thy strength to communicate if aught possess thee from me it is dross usurping ivy brier or idle moss who all for want of pruning with intrusion infect thy sap and live on thy confusion antipholus

to me she speaks she moves me for her theme what was i married to her in my dream or sleep i now and think i hear all this what error drives our eyes and ears amiss until i know this sure uncertainty i'll entertain the offer'd fallacy 

dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner 

o for my beads i cross me for a sinner this is the fairy land o spite of spites we talk with goblins owls and sprites if we obey them not this will ensue they'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue 

why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot 

i am transformed master am i not antipholus

i think thou art in mind and so am i 

nay master both in mind and in my shape antipholus

thou hast thine own form 

no i am an ape 

if thou art changed to aught tis to an ass 

'tis true she rides me and i long for grass tis so i am an ass else it could never be but i should know her as well as she knows me 

come come no longer will i be a fool to put the finger in the eye and weep whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn come sir to dinner dromio keep the gate husband i'll dine above with you to day and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks sirrah if any ask you for your master say he dines forth and let no creature enter come sister dromio play the porter well antipholus

am i in earth in heaven or in hell sleeping or waking mad or well advised known unto these and to myself disguised i'll say as they say and persever so and in this mist at all adventures go 

master shall i be porter at the gate 

ay and let none enter lest i break your pate

say what you will sir but i know what i know that you beat me at the mart i have your hand to show if the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink your own handwriting would tell you what i think antipholus

i think thou art an ass 

marry so it doth appear by the wrongs i suffer and the blows i bear i should kick being kick'd and being at that pass you would keep from my heels and beware of an ass antipholus

a very reverent body ay such a one as a man may not speak of without he say sir reverence i have but lean luck in the match and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage antipholus

how dost thou mean a fat marriage

what complexion is she of 

swart like my shoe but her face nothing half so clean kept for why she sweats a man may go over shoes in the grime of it antipholus

now out of doubt antipholus is mad else would he never so demean himself a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats and for the same he promised me a chain both one and other he denies me now the reason that i gather he is mad besides this present instance of his rage is a mad tale he told to day at dinner of his own doors being shut against his entrance belike his wife acquainted with his fits on purpose shut the doors against his way my way is now to hie home to his house and tell his wife that being lunatic he rush'd into my house and took perforce my ring away this course i fittest choose for forty ducats is too much to lose

scene i a street before a priory 

enter second merchant and angelo

i am sorry sir that i have hinder'd you but i protest he had the chain of me though most dishonestly he doth deny it 

second merchant

how is the man esteemed here in the city 

of very reverend reputation sir of credit infinite highly beloved second to none that lives here in the city his word might bear my wealth at any time 

second merchant

speak softly yonder as i think he walks enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse

'tis so and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have good sir draw near to me i'll speak to him signior antipholus i wonder much that you would put me to this shame and trouble and not without some scandal to yourself with circumstance and oaths so to deny this chain which now you wear so openly beside the charge the shame imprisonment you have done wrong to this my honest friend who but for staying on our controversy had hoisted sail and put to sea to day this chain you had of me can you deny it antipholus

i think i had i never did deny it 

second merchant

yes that you did sir and forswore it too antipholus

who heard me to deny it or forswear it 

second merchant

these ears of mine thou know'st did hear thee fie on thee wretch tis pity that thou livest to walk where any honest man resort antipholus

thou art a villain to impeach me thus i'll prove mine honour and mine honesty against thee presently if thou darest stand 

second merchant

i dare and do defy thee for a villain they draw enter adriana luciana the courtezan and others

hold hurt him not for god's sake he is mad some get within him take his sword away bind dromio too and bear them to my house 

run master run for god's sake take a house this is some priory in or we are spoil'd exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse to the priory enter the lady abbess aemilia

be quiet people wherefore throng you hither 

to fetch my poor distracted husband hence let us come in that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery 

i knew he was not in his perfect wits 

second merchant

i am sorry now that i did draw on him 

how long hath this possession held the man 

this week he hath been heavy sour sad and much different from the man he was but till this afternoon his passion ne'er brake into extremity of rage 

hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea buried some dear friend hath not else his eye stray'd his affection in unlawful love a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing which of these sorrows is he subject to 

to none of these except it be the last namely some love that drew him oft from home 

you should for that have reprehended him 

why so i did 

ay but not rough enough 

as roughly as my modesty would let me 

haply in private 

and in assemblies too 

ay but not enough 

it was the copy of our conference in bed he slept not for my urging it at board he fed not for my urging it alone it was the subject of my theme in company i often glanced it still did i tell him it was vile and bad 

and thereof came it that the man was mad the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth it seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing and therefore comes it that his head is light thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions thereof the raging fire of fever bred and what's a fever but a fit of madness thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life in food in sport and life preserving rest to be disturb'd would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits 

she never reprehended him but mildly when he demean'd himself rough rude and wildly why bear you these rebukes and answer not 

she did betray me to my own reproof good people enter and lay hold on him 

no not a creature enters in my house 

then let your servants bring my husband forth 

neither he took this place for sanctuary and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again or lose my labour in assaying it 

i will attend my husband be his nurse diet his sickness for it is my office and will have no attorney but myself and therefore let me have him home with me 

be patient for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers to make of him a formal man again it is a branch and parcel of mine oath a charitable duty of my order therefore depart and leave him here with me 

i will not hence and leave my husband here and ill it doth beseem your holiness to separate the husband and the wife 

be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him 

complain unto the duke of this indignity 

come go i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess 

second merchant

by this i think the dial points at five anon i'm sure the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale the place of death and sorry execution behind the ditches of the abbey here 

upon what cause 

second merchant

to see a reverend syracusian merchant who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town beheaded publicly for his offence 

see where they come we will behold his death 

kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey enter duke solinus attended aegeon bareheaded with the headsman and other officers

yet once again proclaim it publicly if any friend will pay the sum for him he shall not die so much we tender him 

justice most sacred duke against the abbess 

she is a virtuous and a reverend lady it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong 

may it please your grace antipholus my husband whom i made lord of me and all i had at your important letters this ill day a most outrageous fit of madness took him that desperately he hurried through the street with him his bondman all as mad as he doing displeasure to the citizens by rushing in their houses bearing thence rings jewels any thing his rage did like once did i get him bound and sent him home whilst to take order for the wrongs i went that here and there his fury had committed anon i wot not by what strong escape he broke from those that had the guard of him and with his mad attendant and himself each one with ireful passion with drawn swords met us again and madly bent on us chased us away till raising of more aid we came again to bind them then they fled into this abbey whither we pursued them and here the abbess shuts the gates on us and will not suffer us to fetch him out nor send him forth that we may bear him hence therefore most gracious duke with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help 

long since thy husband served me in my wars and i to thee engaged a prince's word when thou didst make him master of thy bed to do him all the grace and good i could go some of you knock at the abbey gate and bid the lady abbess come to me i will determine this before i stir enter a servant

servant

o mistress mistress shift and save yourself my master and his man are both broke loose beaten the maids a row and bound the doctor whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire and ever as it blazed they threw on him great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair my master preaches patience to him and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool and sure unless you send some present help between them they will kill the conjurer 

peace fool thy master and his man are here and that is false thou dost report to us 

servant

mistress upon my life i tell you true i have not breathed almost since i did see it he cries for you and vows if he can take you to scorch your face and to disfigure you cry within hark hark i hear him mistress fly be gone

ay me it is my husband witness you that he is borne about invisible even now we housed him in the abbey here and now he's there past thought of human reason enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus antipholus

justice most gracious duke o grant me justice even for the service that long since i did thee when i bestrid thee in the wars and took deep scars to save thy life even for the blood that then i lost for thee now grant me justice 

unless the fear of death doth make me dote i see my son antipholus and dromio antipholus

justice sweet prince against that woman there she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife that hath abused and dishonour'd me even in the strength and height of injury beyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me 

discover how and thou shalt find me just antipholus

this day great duke she shut the doors upon me while she with harlots feasted in my house 

a grievous fault say woman didst thou so 

no my good lord myself he and my sister to day did dine together so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal 

ne'er may i look on day nor sleep on night but she tells to your highness simple truth 

o perjured woman they are both forsworn in this the madman justly chargeth them antipholus

my liege i am advised what i say neither disturbed with the effect of wine nor heady rash provoked with raging ire albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad this woman lock'd me out this day from dinner that goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her could witness it for he was with me then who parted with me to go fetch a chain promising to bring it to the porpentine where balthazar and i did dine together our dinner done and he not coming thither i went to seek him in the street i met him and in his company that gentleman there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him received the chain which god he knows i saw not for the which he did arrest me with an officer i did obey and sent my peasant home for certain ducats he with none return'd then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house by the way we met my wife her sister and a rabble more of vile confederates along with them they brought one pinch a hungry lean faced villain a mere anatomy a mountebank a threadbare juggler and a fortune teller a needy hollow eyed sharp looking wretch a dead looking man this pernicious slave forsooth took on him as a conjurer and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse and with no face as twere outfacing me cries out i was possess'd then all together they fell upon me bound me bore me thence and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man both bound together till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder i gain'd my freedom and immediately ran hither to your grace whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities 

my lord in truth thus far i witness with him that he dined not at home but was lock'd out 

but had he such a chain of thee or no 

he had my lord and when he ran in here these people saw the chain about his neck 

second merchant

besides i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him after you first forswore it on the mart and thereupon i drew my sword on you and then you fled into this abbey here from whence i think you are come by miracle antipholus

i never came within these abbey walls nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me i never saw the chain so help me heaven and this is false you burden me withal 

why what an intricate impeach is this i think you all have drunk of circe's cup if here you housed him here he would have been if he were mad he would not plead so coldly you say he dined at home the goldsmith here denies that saying sirrah what say you 

sir he dined with her there at the porpentine 

courtezan

he did and from my finger snatch'd that ring antipholus

'tis true my liege this ring i had of her 

saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here 

courtezan

as sure my liege as i do see your grace 

why this is strange go call the abbess hither i think you are all mated or stark mad exit one to abbess

most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me 

speak freely syracusian what thou wilt 

is not your name sir call'd antipholus and is not that your bondman dromio 

within this hour i was his bondman sir but he i thank him gnaw'd in two my cords now am i dromio and his man unbound 

i am sure you both of you remember me 

ourselves we do remember sir by you for lately we were bound as you are now you are not pinch's patient are you sir 

why look you strange on me you know me well 

i never saw you in my life till now 

o grief hath changed me since you saw me last and careful hours with time's deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice antipholus

neither 

dromio nor thou 

no trust me sir nor i 

i am sure thou dost 

ay sir but i am sure i do not and whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to believe him 

not know my voice o time's extremity hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares though now this grained face of mine be hid in sap consuming winter's drizzled snow and all the conduits of my blood froze up yet hath my night of life some memory my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left my dull deaf ears a little use to hear all these old witnesses i cannot err tell me thou art my son antipholus antipholus

i never saw my father in my life 

but seven years since in syracusa boy thou know'st we parted but perhaps my son thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery antipholus

the duke and all that know me in the city can witness with me that it is not so i ne'er saw syracusa in my life 

i tell thee syracusian twenty years have i been patron to antipholus during which time he ne'er saw syracusa i see thy age and dangers make thee dote re enter aemilia with antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse

most mighty duke behold a man much wrong'd all gather to see them

i see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me 

one of these men is genius to the other and so of these which is the natural man and which the spirit who deciphers them 

i sir am dromio command him away 

i sir am dromio pray let me stay antipholus

aegeon art thou not or else his ghost 

o my old master who hath bound him here 

whoever bound him i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty speak old aegeon if thou be'st the man that hadst a wife once call'd aemilia that bore thee at a burden two fair sons o if thou be'st the same aegeon speak and speak unto the same aemilia 

if i dream not thou art aemilia if thou art she tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft 

by men of epidamnum he and i and the twin dromio all were taken up but by and by rude fishermen of corinth by force took dromio and my son from them and me they left with those of epidamnum what then became of them i cannot tell i to this fortune that you see me in 

why here begins his morning story right these two antipholuses these two so like and these two dromios one in semblance besides her urging of her wreck at sea these are the parents to these children which accidentally are met together antipholus thou camest from corinth first antipholus

no sir not i i came from syracuse 

stay stand apart i know not which is which antipholus

i came from corinth my most gracious lord 

and i with him antipholus

brought to this town by that most famous warrior duke menaphon your most renowned uncle 

which of you two did dine with me to day antipholus

i gentle mistress 

and are not you my husband antipholus

no i say nay to that antipholus

and so do i yet did she call me so and this fair gentlewoman her sister here did call me brother to luciana what i told you then i hope i shall have leisure to make good if this be not a dream i see and hear 

that is the chain sir which you had of me antipholus

i think it be sir i deny it not antipholus

and you sir for this chain arrested me 

i think i did sir i deny it not 

i sent you money sir to be your bail by dromio but i think he brought it not 

no none by me antipholus

this purse of ducats i received from you and dromio my man did bring them me i see we still did meet each other's man and i was ta'en for him and he for me and thereupon these errors are arose antipholus

these ducats pawn i for my father here 

it shall not need thy father hath his life 

courtezan

sir i must have that diamond from you antipholus

there take it and much thanks for my good cheer 

renowned duke vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes and all that are assembled in this place that by this sympathized one day's error have suffer'd wrong go keep us company and we shall make full satisfaction thirty three years have i but gone in travail of you my sons and till this present hour my heavy burden ne'er delivered the duke my husband and my children both and you the calendars of their nativity go to a gossips feast and go with me after so long grief such festivity 

with all my heart i'll gossip at this feast exeunt all but antipholus of syracuse antipholus of ephesus dromio of syracuse and dromio of ephesus

master shall i fetch your stuff from shipboard antipholus
